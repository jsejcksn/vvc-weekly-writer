In this type of writing, students have to utilize their  &#10; mode writing skills of describing, telling a story, explaining, or supporting an opinion. To  &#10; answer open-ended or essay questions, students have to RIP the texts from sources to fully  &#10; comprehend the material.   &#10; In this particular exercise, students will read passages that include descriptive writing. The  &#10; questions following the passages ask the students to do a variety of tasks:  &#10; &#8226; They have to identify descriptive details in the passage. The descriptive words are actually  &#10; an example of onomatopoeia. If this is new to the student, it is an excellent teachable  &#10; moment.  &#10; &#8226; Students have to explain how the passages are different. Even though this response is not  &#10; a descriptive response, it applies a foundational concept of explaining.  &#10; &#8226; Students have to continue a passage with two sentences of their own descriptive writing. &#10;
