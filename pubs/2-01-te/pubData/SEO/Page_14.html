		RIP &#38; Write &#10; *Remember, RIP stands for &#8220;Read, Interpret, Predict&#8221;  &#10; Reading to comprehend can be hard. Sometimes, you may read the words in a sentence,  &#10; but you may not know what it all means. In Let&#8217;s Write, Mr. Butler and RIP worked very hard  &#10; to put words together to create complete sentences with details and descriptive language.   &#10; RIP is named after a reading strategy to help boys and girls be better readers. As you read,  &#10; you will ask questions. We call that interpret. Then, you are going to think about what  &#10; could happen next. We call that predict. The first letter of each word creates our furry  &#10; superhero&#8217;s name - R-I-P. Are you ready to RIP this passage?  &#10; How Many Boats?  &#10; Read  &#10; Read a small part of the text. As you read, remember to stop at the periods. Picture what&#8217;s  &#10; happening in your imagination. Read with expression even if you are reading in your mind!  &#10;   Steven and Amanda went to the marina to look at the beautiful sailboats. Steven saw  &#10; six blue sailboats with four people in each boat.  &#10;    &#10; Interpret  &#10; We&#8217;re not finished reading the passage, but let&#8217;s stop and interpret by asking some  &#10; questions.  &#10; &#8226; Where are Steven and Amanda?   &#10; &#8226; What are they doing there?  &#10; &#8226; Which words are descriptive?  &#10; &#8226; How many sailboats did Steven see? How many people were in each boat?  &#10; &#8226; Can you use mental math to find out how many people Steven saw all together?  &#10; Predict  &#10; &#8226; What do you think will happen next?  &#10; &#8226; What do you think Amanda will see?   &#10; &#8226; Will she see more or less than Steven?  &#10;
