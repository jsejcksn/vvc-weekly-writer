		 LET&#8217;S SOURCE WRITE!  &#10; It is important to write your answers in complete sentences. Do not answer &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221;  &#10; Let&#8217;s practice:  &#10; After reading passage #1 and passage #2, do you think these are descriptive  &#10; passages?   &#10; If you answered, &#8220;yes,&#8221; you would be correct, but the word &#8220;yes&#8221; is not a complete  &#10; sentence.   &#10; Answer:  &#10; Passage #1 and passage #2 are descriptive.   &#10; Your Turn &#8212;  &#10; 1. In passage #1, which words helped you hear the rain?   &#10; &#8220;Drip, drop. Drip, drop.&#8221; are the words that help me hear the rain.   &#10; 2. In passage #2, Ellie feels differently about the thunder than the squirrel did in passage #1.  &#10; How did Ellie feel different?   &#10; Ellie felt different because she was not scared like the squirrel.   &#10; 3. Using descriptive language, ADD two complete descriptive sentences to passage #1.  &#10; Imagine the wind is causing the trees to sway.  &#10; Tall, pointy pines sway on the horizon. They bow to me. &#10;
