		&#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual  RIP &#38; Write  &#10; Teacher&#8217;s Guide &#10; GUIDE  &#10; RIP is a close reading strategy designed to help students fully comprehend what they are  &#10; reading. The elements of RIP pull from well-known, research-based reading strategies, and  &#10; put them into an easy process for students of all ages.   &#10; As you guide students through this lesson, point out that after reading the first two  &#10; sentences, a red flag should pop up. This sounds and feels like a math lesson. Watch out!  &#10; Which information is important? In your mind, convert the number words to digits and start  &#10; predicting what math operation you will have to do.  &#10;    &#10; Additionally, take notice of the descriptive language. Is it odd to find descriptive language in  &#10; a math problem? Wow! Is descriptive language truly all around us? We need to be more  &#10; observant.  &#10; Now that we know it&#8217;s a math problem, let&#8217;s be on the lookout for additional information we  &#10; may need to solve a potential problem. And, how will we recognize the instructions? &#10;
