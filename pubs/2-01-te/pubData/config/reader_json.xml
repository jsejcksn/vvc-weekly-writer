When you describe, the reader experiences  &#10; what’s in your imagination. You can describe a person, a place, a thing, or something that  &#10; happens.   &#10; To brainstorm for ideas of what to write about, let’s ask great questions:  &#10; • What do you see?  &#10; • What do you hear?   &#10; • What do you smell?  &#10; • What do you taste?  &#10; • How does it feel to touch?  &#10; • How does it make you feel inside?  &#10; Using your five senses and your emotions gives your writing lots of details about what you  &#10; are describing.  &#10; In the video, Mr. Butler will walk you through the writing process of brainstorming,  &#10; planning, writing, and revising and editing.  &#10; "},{"text":"Let’s Write!  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10;

ASSESSMENT  &#10; What should you expect of your students? The prompt asks for three or more sentences  &#10; describing the bowl of fruit. To assess this activity, you need to assess the writing process as  &#10; well.   &#10; • Did they brainstorm?  &#10; • Did they make a bullet plan?  &#10; • Did they write three or more sentences using the plan and the brainstorming? Do the  &#10; sentences reflect descriptive writing? Is there evidence of juicy words - adjectives, action  &#10; verbs, figurative language, etc.? Do the sentences utilize senses and emotions?  &#10; • Did they capitalize the first word of each sentence?   &#10; • Is there end punctuation?  &#10; • Does each sentence make sense?  &#10; Use the rubric to assess their writing. Although your students’ writing may not look exactly  &#10; like this, you will have a general idea of what is acceptable and what isn’t.  &#10; Go to the next page to watch this week’s video. &#10; "},{"text":"Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Village Classroom CLICK © 2015 Virtual Village HERE Classroom © 2015 TO Virtual Village VIEW © 2015 Virtual THIS Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom ©  &#10;

Summary  &#10; In the video, you learned the keyword for descriptive writing is describe. When you see this  &#10; word in directions, you will know you need to describe.   &#10; Mr. Butler helped you brainstorm ways to describe a bowl of fruit by using a web. RIP helped  &#10; Mr. Butler make a plan for describing. They used bullets as a way to organize the plan.  &#10; Sentence by sentence, Mr. Butler modeled complete sentences that described the bowl of  &#10; fruit. Finally, RIP helped Mr. Butler revise and edit the paragraph.  &#10; Your Turn!  &#10; Write three or more sentences on your own or with your teacher that describes a bowl of  &#10; fruit. You can use ideas from the brainstorming session with Mr. Butler, or you can create new  &#10; ones on your own. As you describe, be sure to follow the writing process of brainstorming,  &#10; planning, writing, and revising and editing to create your sentences. &#10; "},{"text":"Let’s Write!  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10;

RUBRIC &#10; Exceeds Standards:  &#10; A delicious bowl of fruit rests on my kitchen table. A juicy, crimson apple begs me to take  &#10; a bite. A long, pale yellow banana peeks out of the bowl waiting to be peeled. The juicy  &#10; orange makes my mouth water just thinking about taking a bite. &#10; Meets Standards:  &#10; A yummy bowl of fruit sits on my kitchen table. The red, juicy apple wants me to take a  &#10; bite. The large, yellow banana is asking me to peel it. I can’t wait to peel the orange and  &#10; let the juice explode in my mouth. &#10; Below Standards:  &#10; i see a bowl of fruit  there is an apple and a banana and an orange. It looks good. I like it.  &#10; That’s what I see in the bowl. &#10; CLICK  &#10; Understanding the skills is quite different from the application of skills. When understanding  &#10; meets application, I call that a “click.” It’s like a puzzle piece finding its companion.   &#10; In this activity, the application of the writing process is the click. When your students apply  &#10; the process viewed in the modeling video to their own writing, they will understand how  &#10; following the process removes frustration from their writing.  &#10; "},{"text":"Conventions &#10;

fruit. Were the sentences complete? Or, were they fragments or run-on sentences?  &#10; A complete sentence is a group of words beginning with a capital letter and ending with a  &#10; period, exclamation point, or question mark. The sentence is a complete thought. Here is an  &#10; example:  &#10; I enjoy reading in my hammock.   &#10; A fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It may begin with  &#10; a capital letter and have ending punctuation but still not be a complete thought. Let’s look at  &#10; a fragment:  &#10; The big brown dog.  &#10; Notice how the fragment told what the sentence would be about but never actually  &#10; completed the thought.   &#10; A run-on sentence is a sentence made up of two or more complete thoughts that have not  &#10; been connected properly. See if you can find what is wrong with this run-on sentence:  &#10; I like to play soccer and I also like to play basketball and I like to play football.   &#10; Run-on sentences can often be fixed by adding a comma and a conjunction (and, but, or)  &#10; between complete thoughts or making each thought a complete sentence.  In this case,  &#10; there are too many thoughts connected by the word “and.” The sentence could easily fixed  &#10; by writing:   &#10; I like to play soccer, basketball, and football.  &#10; "},{"text":"Conventions  &#10;

It is one of the six traits of writing  &#10; and commonly part of analytical assessment scoring.   &#10; In Weekly Writer, the instructional videos focus on holistic content writing first and editing for  &#10; punctuation, grammar, and spelling at the end of the writing process. Students need to focus  &#10; on first on their content. If the content of the writing isn’t sound, then there is little need to  &#10; edit. By nature, language arts teachers want to edit first for conventions, but if the student  &#10; has to go back and rewrite sentences for content, then they feel like they’ve wasted their  &#10; efforts.   &#10; Therefore, it is important for you to focus on the content of their writing as a primary goal.  &#10; When the content is firm, then ask the student to edit for punctuation, grammar, and  &#10; spelling.   &#10; In Conventions, the goal is to make basic punctuation and grammar second nature to the  &#10; young writer. Consider these basics:  &#10; • Capitalize the first word of a sentence  &#10; • Capitalize the word “I”  &#10; • Capitalize proper nouns  &#10; • Add end punctuation for a statement, a question, or exclamation &#10; Go to the next page for checking for understanding of this week’s conventions. &#10; "},{"text":"CHECKING FOR UNDERSTANDING  &#10; Decide whether each group of words is a complete sentence, a fragment, or a run-on  &#10; sentence.

As described  &#10; above, your constant modeling of writing complete sentences is vital. The continued  &#10; discussion is vital. Pointing it out in reading passages, your reading series, or any examples is  &#10; vital.   &#10; How many times have you heard a teacher say, “They can’t even write a complete sentence.”  &#10; To eradicate that statement, we have to make the writing of complete thoughts real to our  &#10; students and never assume “they get it.”   &#10; This concept will be a constant “click” each time you write. As you observe your students, be  &#10; mindful of those who master this concept and those that need more attention.  &#10; "},{"text":"Application &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

Asking  &#10; great questions will help you find great details to use in your writing.   &#10; Soon, you will learn to write stories. You will need to describe the characters in your stories  &#10; so the reader will have a clear picture in their imagination. Like this—  &#10;   Two blonde piggy tails bounced on Ellie’s back as she skipped down the sidewalk.  &#10; She stopped on the corner to make sure the road was clear. As she looked down, Ellie  &#10; spotted a puddle of water, and her sparkling blue eyes stared back at her.   &#10; In this paragraph, there are many ways Ellie was described. Can you answer these questions?  &#10; 1. What color is Ellie’s hair?   &#10; 2. What words described her hairstyle?  &#10; 3. What color are Ellie’s eyes? How do you know?  &#10; 4. Based on the passage, what kind of personality does Ellie have? What word or words in  &#10; the passage gave you a clue?  &#10; Before we can describe a character in a narrative story, we need to create a character, and we  &#10; need to practice describing them. Let’s begin with you! Complete The Character Worksheet  &#10; and the writing activity about yourself. &#10; "},{"text":"Application  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

ASSESSMENT  &#10; This is an ongoing activity for the student. Make multiple copies of these and put them in an  &#10; easily accessible spot in your classroom.   &#10; When a student has an idea for a character, they can fill out a Character Worksheet and add  &#10; it to their Writer’s Workbook. I like to see second graders develop the following types of  &#10; characters:  &#10; • Main Characters - These are characters the student wants to use as the main focus of a  &#10; story.  &#10; • Allies - These are friends of the main character  &#10; • Opponents - These are good and bad opponents.  Good opponents are teachers,  &#10; parents, and friends who have the best interest of the main character at heart. Bad  &#10; opponents are bullies or other bad guys in their stories.  &#10; I highly suggest developing some classroom characters for the entire class to write about in  &#10; your modeling lessons. I have seen some amazing examples of how teachers have used  &#10; classroom characters to reinforce character education concepts through narratives they wrote  &#10; in modeling activities. Make these classroom characters part of your classroom family.  &#10; Go to the next page for the “apply it!” section of this week’s application. &#10; "},{"text":"APPLY IT!  &#10; The Character Worksheet  &#10;

middle of a week focused on descriptive? Great question. Narrative writing is where we find  &#10; a great deal of descriptive writing.We have to describe characters, settings, and objects all  &#10; the time.   &#10; To begin with, students need to start building a collection of character worksheets for their  &#10; narrative writing. Don’t let this one be the only one you do. Encourage your students to do  &#10; several of these over a period of time.   &#10; Additionally, the Character Worksheet asks the students to be observant about what they see  &#10; in their imaginations, and they have to describe as well. This is an excellent opportunity for  &#10; you to drive home the message about descriptive not being just the sense of “seeing.”  &#10; Describing must include all of the sense and emotions to be well-rounded.   &#10; There are many opportunities for you to provide “clicks” to your students as you work  &#10; through these activities. Use character descriptions in the passages located in your reading  &#10; series as well as read-alouds conducted in your classroom.  &#10; "},{"text":"RIP & Write &#10; *Remember, RIP stands for “Read, Interpret, Predict”  &#10; Reading to comprehend can be hard. Sometimes, you may read the words in a sentence,  &#10; but you may not know what it all means. In Let’s Write, Mr. Butler and RIP worked very hard  &#10; to put words together to create complete sentences with details and descriptive language.   &#10; RIP is named after a reading strategy to help boys and girls be better readers. As you read,  &#10; you will ask questions. We call that interpret. Then, you are going to think about what  &#10; could happen next. We call that predict. The first letter of each word creates our furry  &#10; superhero’s name - R-I-P. Are you ready to RIP this passage?  &#10; How Many Boats?  &#10; Read  &#10; Read a small part of the text. As you read, remember to stop at the periods. Picture what’s  &#10; happening in your imagination. Read with expression even if you are reading in your mind!  &#10;   Steven and Amanda went to the marina to look at the beautiful sailboats. Steven saw  &#10; six blue sailboats with four people in each boat.  &#10;    &#10; Interpret  &#10; We’re not finished reading the passage, but let’s stop and interpret by asking some  &#10; questions.  &#10; • Where are Steven and Amanda?   &#10; • What are they doing there?  &#10; • Which words are descriptive?  &#10; • How many sailboats did Steven see? How many people were in each boat?  &#10; • Can you use mental math to find out how many people Steven saw all together?  &#10; Predict  &#10; • What do you think will happen next?  &#10; • What do you think Amanda will see?   &#10; • Will she see more or less than Steven?  &#10; "},{"text":"© 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual  RIP & Write  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10; GUIDE  &#10; RIP is a close reading strategy designed to help students fully comprehend what they are  &#10; reading.

This sounds and feels like a math lesson. Watch out!  &#10; Which information is important? In your mind, convert the number words to digits and start  &#10; predicting what math operation you will have to do.  &#10;    &#10; Additionally, take notice of the descriptive language. Is it odd to find descriptive language in  &#10; a math problem? Wow! Is descriptive language truly all around us? We need to be more  &#10; observant.  &#10; Now that we know it’s a math problem, let’s be on the lookout for additional information we  &#10; may need to solve a potential problem.

Other times, your teacher will ask you  &#10; questions about what you think based on what you have read.   &#10; When you have two or more types of information to look at, the writing you create will be  &#10; called source writing. You will compare the information from all of the sources to answer  &#10; questions for your teacher.   &#10; To answer the questions, you will have to use your own words. If you copy the words from  &#10; the sources, you are a copycat! To learn how to write from sources, you need to practice. In  &#10; this lesson, you will use what you’ve learned this week to complete the writing activity.  &#10; The Coming Rain  &#10;   The soft, cool breeze tickles Tom’s cheek. Drip, drop. Drip, drop. Droplets of rain fall  &#10; on his head. Thunder echoes in the distance, and Tom spots a scared squirrel running for his  &#10; home.  &#10; Did you RIP the passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued, what do you think  &#10; would happen next?  &#10; Ellie’s Walk Home  &#10;   Ellie looks into the puddle, and her big, blue, sparkling eyes stare back at her. Far  &#10; away, thunder rumbles, and Ellie takes out her bright pink umbrella. Dark, gloomy clouds  &#10; roll across the sky, but Ellie is determined to make it home before it rains again.  &#10; Did you RIP this passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued, what do you think  &#10; would happen next?  &#10; "},{"text":"Source Writing  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual©  &#10; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual  &#10; ASSESSMENT  &#10; Source writing brings everything together. In this type of writing, students have to utilize their  &#10; mode writing skills of describing, telling a story, explaining, or supporting an opinion. To  &#10; answer open-ended or essay questions, students have to RIP the texts from sources to fully  &#10; comprehend the material.   &#10; In this particular exercise, students will read passages that include descriptive writing. The  &#10; questions following the passages ask the students to do a variety of tasks:  &#10; • They have to identify descriptive details in the passage. The descriptive words are actually  &#10; an example of onomatopoeia. If this is new to the student, it is an excellent teachable  &#10; moment.  &#10; • Students have to explain how the passages are different. Even though this response is not  &#10; a descriptive response, it applies a foundational concept of explaining.  &#10; • Students have to continue a passage with two sentences of their own descriptive writing. &#10; "},{"text":" LET’S SOURCE WRITE!  &#10; It is important to write your answers in complete sentences. Do not answer “yes” or “no.”  &#10; Let’s practice:  &#10; After reading passage #1 and passage #2, do you think these are descriptive  &#10; passages?   &#10; If you answered, “yes,” you would be correct, but the word “yes” is not a complete  &#10; sentence.   &#10; Answer:  &#10; Passage #1 and passage #2 are descriptive.   &#10; Your Turn —  &#10; 1. In passage #1, which words helped you hear the rain?   &#10; “Drip, drop. Drip, drop.” are the words that help me hear the rain.   &#10; 2. In passage #2, Ellie feels differently about the thunder than the squirrel did in passage #1.  &#10; How did Ellie feel different?   &#10; Ellie felt different because she was not scared like the squirrel.   &#10; 3. Using descriptive language, ADD two complete descriptive sentences to passage #1.  &#10; Imagine the wind is causing the trees to sway.  &#10; Tall, pointy pines sway on the horizon. They bow to me. &#10; "},{"text":"Source Writing  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

They  &#10; have to:  &#10; • Read to comprehend using the RIP strategy  &#10; • Use the writing process to write two additional descriptive sentences  &#10; • Use comprehension skills to identify differences in descriptive passages with regard to  &#10; emotion  &#10; • Write in complete sentences  &#10; Each step of the way, you are making “clicks” for your students. Help them to make these  &#10; connections. It may seem obvious to you and to me, but our young writers need you to  &#10; connect the dots. By doing this, they will begin to do this independently as they write on  &#10; their own.  &#10; "}],"pageContentHolders":{"page6":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":1}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[739,39,55,55],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}],"page5":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":1}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[740,36,55,55],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}],"page4":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"OPEN_VIDEO_IN_WINDOW","videoSrc":"http://e8ec7dc7c085d3470af6-1afcbbc818dfc5846ab38b22649863b7.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/WW_EC01.flv","videoSrcType":"LINK"}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[16,17,804,195],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}],"page2":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":1}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[741,36,55,55],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}],"page10":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":1}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[739,39,55,55],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}],"page1":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[16,17,722,292],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}},{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[739,94,80,215],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}},{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":1}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[740,36,55,55],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}},{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":2}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[15,489,804,90],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}},{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":6}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[15,593,804,90],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}},{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":10}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[14,696,804,90],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}},{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":14}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[15,799,804,90],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}},{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":18}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[15,900,804,90],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}],"page21":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":1}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[739,36,55,55],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}],"page14":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":1}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[739,36,55,55],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}],"page13":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":1}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[740,36,55,55],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}],"page18":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":1}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[739,37,55,55],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}],"page9":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":1}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[740,36,55,55],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}],"page17":[{"className":"emc.shape::Shape","events":[{"actions":[{"actionType":"GOTO_PAGE_N","pageNumber":1}],"type":"MOUSE_CLICK"}],"positioning":[739,36,55,55],"properties":{"border":["#000000",0.0,1],"fill":["#00ccff",0.0]}}]},"imageWidths":{"ipad":[70,90,718,929,1243,1608],"images":[70,90,834,1079,1536,1987],"iphone":[70,90,320,414,1243,1608]},"readerStyleID":"WhiteGadget"}
