2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169;  &#10; ASSESSMENT  &#10; This is an ongoing activity for the student. Make multiple copies of The Character Worksheet  &#10; and place them in an easily accessible spot in your classroom.   &#10; When a student has an idea for a character, they can fill out a Character Worksheet and add  &#10; it to their Writer&#8217;s Workbook. I like to see eighth graders develop the following types of  &#10; characters:  &#10; &#8226; Main Characters - These are characters the student wants to use as the main focus of a  &#10; story.  &#10; &#8226; Allies - These are friends of the main character  &#10; &#8226; Opponents - These are good and bad opponents.  Good opponents are teachers,  &#10; parents, and friends who have the best interest of the main character at heart. Bad  &#10; opponents are bullies or other bad guys in their stories.  &#10; &#8226; Ally-Opponent OR Opponent-Ally - These are characters who begin as one type of  &#10; character but develop into another due to the circumstances of the story.  &#10; I highly suggest developing some classroom characters for the entire class to write about in  &#10; your modeling lessons. I have seen amazing examples of how teachers have used classroom  &#10; characters to reinforce character education concepts through narratives they wrote in  &#10; modeling activities. Make these classroom characters part of your classroom family.   &#10; There is an example included in the answer key of how an eighth grader might fill out the  &#10; Character Worksheet. As you review their choices, encourage them to make their character  &#10; their age and grade. There is nothing wrong with having a variety of ages as they develop  &#10; additional characters, but for the time being, they should create about what they know in  &#10; their world.  &#10;
