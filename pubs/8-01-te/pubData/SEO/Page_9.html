2015 Virtual  &#10; This is a great group activity for an interactive white board. Feel free to print out the activity  &#10; sheet and let the students do it on their own or with a partner. This activity can also be  &#10; projected on your interactive white board or viewed on a tablet or computer with the  &#10; students answering on notebook paper.  &#10; As teachers, we believe the recognition of nouns in a sentence should be easy for an eighth  &#10; grader. However, that is not always the case. They struggle with the difference in &#8220;noun&#8221; and  &#10; &#8220;subject.&#8221; The subject of the sentence is a noun, but there are other nouns in the sentence.   &#10; This activity will help you promote the recognition of nouns under differing circumstances.   &#10; As you work through the week, ask your students to identify nouns in their own writing.   &#10; Each time you write with your eighth graders, take the time to analyze the structure of each  &#10; sentence. Consider diagramming a sentence to help your students understand the structure  &#10; and organization.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; For this Conventions lesson to click, you will have help connect the pieces. As described  &#10; above, your constant modeling of pointing out different uses of nouns.   &#10; Many times we assume our students understand because no one is raising their hand.  &#10; However, consider the possibility that you have students who are afraid to raise their hands  &#10; for fear of being ridiculed. On the surface, a noun seems like a very simple thing to  &#10; recognize, but you may have to connect the dots for them.    &#10; This concept will be a constant &#8220;click&#8221; each time you write. As you observe your students, be  &#10; mindful of those who master this concept and those who need more attention.  &#10;
