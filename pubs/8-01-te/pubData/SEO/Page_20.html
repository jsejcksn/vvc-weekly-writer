		Let&#8217;s Source Write   &#10; Step one in source writing is understanding. If you have read the two passages, you are  &#10; aware of how different they are. One is a descriptive passage and one is an explanatory  &#10; passage. How do you know that?   &#10; The Approaching Storm is written from the author&#8217;s viewpoint and describes what the  &#10; author sees, hears, and feels as a storm develops. Clouds, Storms, and Rain gives you  &#10; information about the elements in a storm. Notice the credit to Wikipedia, an online free  &#10; encyclopedia.   &#10; The next step is to answer the following questions in one or two sentences. This will help  &#10; you determine if you RIP&#8217;ed the passages to clearly understand details, structure, and your  &#10; own interpretation as it relates to you.  &#10; Answer, Reply, or Instruction  &#10; Answer the following questions in one or two sentences. To the best of your ability, give credit to the  &#10; passage where you found the information. Refer to the passage by its title.  &#10; For example &#8212; In A Rainy Afternoon, the onomatopoeia enables the reader to hear the rain falling.   When  &#10; you use the title in your answer, you are giving credit to the passage.  &#10; Your turn!  &#10; 1. In your opinion, does the author of the passage like the rain?  Use evidence from the  &#10; passage to support your opinion.  &#10; 2. Where does rain come from? Use information from the passage to explain in detail.   &#10; 3. Write two additional descriptive sentences to continue the descriptive passage, A Rainy  &#10; Afternoon. Be sure to stay in the same style and voice as the author.  &#10;
