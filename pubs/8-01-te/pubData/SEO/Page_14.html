		RIP &#38; Write &#10; *Remember, RIP stands for &#8220;Read, Interpret, Predict&#8221;  &#10; Reading to comprehend is a skill all to itself. Often, students skim and scan a passage and  &#10; call that reading. Skimming and scanning is a wonderful skill to get an idea of what the  &#10; passage is about, however, it never replaces close reading. When you close read a passage  &#10; you will discover details and inferences in the words.   &#10; RIP is a reading strategy to help you close read a passage. As you read the math word  &#10; problem, you will be guided through the RIP strategy.  &#10; Tornado Sirens  &#10; Read  &#10; Read a short portion of the text. As you read, remember to stop at the periods. Picture  &#10; what&#8217;s happening in your imagination. Read with expression even if you are reading in your  &#10; mind!  &#10;   The city has just installed new tornado sirens in strategic locations  &#10; throughout the city to help keep everyone safe in the event of severe weather.  &#10; The sirens are on 65 foot poles. Workers attach four guy-wires to stakes in the  &#10; ground 30 feet from the pole.  &#10; Interpret  &#10; We&#8217;re not finished reading the passage, but let&#8217;s stop and interpret by asking some  &#10; questions.  &#10; &#8226; What is the subject of the problem?   &#10; &#8226; How do you know it&#8217;s a math problem? What context clues tell you this?  &#10; &#8226; Is &#8220;guy-wire&#8221; a real term? What do you picture in your mind when you hear this term?  &#10; Predict  &#10; &#8226; Is a guy-wire a wire that holds up a pole?   &#10; &#8226; Is the problem going to ask me to determine how much guy-wire they need?  &#10;
