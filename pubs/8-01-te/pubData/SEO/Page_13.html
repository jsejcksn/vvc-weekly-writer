activity while we&#8217;re working on descriptive?&#8221; Fair question. Although writing has been broken  &#10; down into &#8220;modes&#8221; of writing, I firmly believe students must learn how to divide and  &#10; conquer! They must be prepared to write in any mode or mix the modes at any time. Do we  &#10; not describe in a narrative or possibly in a science or social studies question? Use this activity  &#10; to build awareness and observational skills with your students. Allow this to transfer into  &#10; other curricular areas as well.  &#10; In the descriptive sentences, make sure your students are not explaining details about the  &#10; character. In other words, if they write &#8212; Everyone loves her because she smiles all the time.  &#10; &#8212; point out that this is explaining &#8220;why&#8221; they like her. Notice how I reversed the same  &#10; concept by letting the character have the action. She smiles all the time, and everyone loves  &#10; her.  I deleted the word &#8220;because&#8221; and used the action verbs &#8220;smile&#8221; and &#8220;loves&#8221; to show  &#10; instead of tell or explain.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; Allow this activity to click into multiple activities. Imagine your students filling out a Character  &#10; Worksheet on another classmate, or a character from a novel they are reading, or a character  &#10; from a story in your reading series.   &#10; As for their own work,  students need to start building a collection of character worksheets  &#10; for their narrative writing. Don&#8217;t let this one be the only one they do. Encourage your  &#10; students to do several of these over a period of time.   &#10; Additionally, the Character Worksheet asks the students to be observant about what they see  &#10; in their imaginations, and they have to describe as well. This is an excellent opportunity for  &#10; you to drive home the message about descriptive not being just the sense of &#8220;seeing.&#8221;  &#10; Describing must include all of the senses and emotions to be well-rounded.  &#10;
