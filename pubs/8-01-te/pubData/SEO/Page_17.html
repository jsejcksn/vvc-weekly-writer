2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual  &#10; Did you see the question in the instructions. Now, let&#8217;s try to fully understand what the  &#10; question is asking us to do. It will be important to use logical thinking as well as our  &#10; knowledge and ideas from math to determine which approach we should use to solve the  &#10; problem.   &#10; The instructions are clear. We are going to plug in the given information to the Pythagorean  &#10; Theorem since the guy-wires will form right triangles to the base of the poles. The height the  &#10; guy-wires will be attached up the pole will represent a2 (which is unknown) and the distance  &#10; they are staked in the ground will represent b2. The length of the wire will represent c2. When  &#10; these are plugged into the Pythagorean Theorem you get a2 + 900 = 2015. Once that  &#10; equation is solved for a, the answer is the guide wires will be attached approximately 33.5  &#10; feet up the pole.   &#10; As you guide your students through the RIP &#38; Write lesson, you are clearly modeling the  &#10; process step by step. You are not only building reading comprehension skills, but you are  &#10; building logical thinking skills. Too often, we focus on &#8220;thinking out of the box,&#8221; and  &#10; forgetting that students need logical, common sense thinking skills as well. There is nothing  &#10; difficult about this problem if you look at it from a logical perspective.   &#10; When you answer the open-ended questions, be sure to model how students should answer  &#10; in a complete sentence.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; During the week, we have talked about nouns. In math, it is important to answer open-ended  &#10; questions with a complete sentence expressing the answer with details. And, it is important  &#10; that students can recognize nouns in their own writing.   &#10; Use this opportunity to talk about the parallel of sentence variety in language arts to  &#10; sentence variety in math.  &#10; Before they write their answers to the open-ended sentences, consider the purpose of each  &#10; sentence. &#10;
