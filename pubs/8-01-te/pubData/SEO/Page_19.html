One passage is descriptive and one is explanatory. The  &#10; questions following the passages ask the students to do a variety of tasks.  &#10; &#8226; They have to identify descriptive details in the passage.   &#10; &#8226; Students have to use information from the passage to draw conclusions based on  &#10; knowledge and understanding.  &#10; &#8226; Students have to explain the personification and simile by interpreting its meaning from  &#10; the descriptive passage. &#10;
