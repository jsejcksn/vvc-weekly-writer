2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169;  &#10; In your activity, students are asked to locate details from the passage and answer openended  &#10; questions based on information and inference. If they did not RIP the passage, it is  &#10; possible they only skimmed and scanned. The result will be frustrating to them; they will have  &#10; no clue how to answer the questions.   &#10; The first question asks them to state their opinion about whether or not the author likes the  &#10; rain. The evidence to support the answer is there, but the student must understand the  &#10; inference and description of feeling to draw this conclusion.   &#10; The second question asks the student to draw from the informational passage. To do so, they  &#10; must understand the passage and be able to reference information in their response.   &#10; Finally, students are asked to write two additional sentences about the beating drum and the  &#10; rain carrying the author away into a slumber. Guide your students to utilize the writing  &#10; process of brainstorming, planning, writing, and revising and editing to create these two  &#10; sentences. If they are having trouble with this, you may have to model it for them in a group  &#10; activity and then ask them to write two descriptive sentences on their own.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; In Source Writing, students have to utilize the skills they have learned during the week. They  &#10; have to:  &#10; &#8226; Read to comprehend using the RIP strategy  &#10; &#8226; Use the writing process to answer open-ended questions  &#10; &#8226; Use comprehension skills to identify details and information as well as draw conclusions  &#10; &#8226; Write in complete sentences using a variety of sentences  &#10; Each step of the way, you are making &#8220;clicks&#8221; for your students. Help them to make these  &#10; connections. It may seem obvious to you and to me, but our student writers need you to  &#10; connect the dots. By doing this, they will begin to do this independently as they write on  &#10; their own.  &#10;
