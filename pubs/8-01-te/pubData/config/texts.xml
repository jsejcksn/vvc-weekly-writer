2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual  &#10; What is Descriptive Writing?   &#10; Descriptive writing can be a single sentence, a paragraph, or an essay. Many people  &#10; associate descriptive writing with narrative, since stories must be layered with description to  &#10; create visual images in the minds of the reader. As a writer, you will learn that descriptive  &#10; writing is not limited to narrative. It will be in every type of writing you do.  &#10; Aside from the narrative, explanatory, and argumentative modes of writing, descriptive can  &#10; stand alone as its own mode of writing. The writer is the observer, capturing what they see,  &#10; hear, smell, taste, touch, and feel inside.  In this case, descriptives are best written in first  &#10; person and in present tense.   &#10; If you are asked to write in the descriptive mode, you will see the word describe in the  &#10; prompt or instructions. This is called a keyword. The keyword directs you to what kind of  &#10; writing you are supposed to do.  &#10; Describing is like painting pictures with words in the mind of the reader. When we describe,  &#10; we let the reader experience something. It may be a thing, a place, a person, or something  &#10; that happens.   &#10; To describe, you start by brainstorming. Use your senses to ask great questions.  &#10; • What do you see?  &#10; • What do you hear?   &#10; • What do you smell?  &#10; • What do you taste?  &#10; • How does it feel to touch?  &#10; • How does it make you feel inside?  &#10; This last question pulls on your emotions. Writing about how you feel gives great voice and  &#10; expression to your writing.   &#10; In the video, Mr. Butler will walk you through the writing process of brainstorming,  &#10; planning, writing, and revising and editing.  &#10; ]]></text>

2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual  &#10; Your students have been asked to write a descriptive paragraph about a watch. An effective  &#10; approach to the modeling video is to watch it in pieces and interact with your students along  &#10; the way. Watch the introduction and the brainstorming; pause the video; and model with  &#10; your students. The writing process - brainstorming, planning, writing, and revising and  &#10; editing - must become habit. To accomplish that, you will need to constantly model the  &#10; process with them until it becomes natural.  &#10; ASSESSMENT  &#10; What should you expect of your students? The prompt asks for a descriptive paragraph. To  &#10; assess this activity, you need to assess the writing process as well.   &#10; • Did they brainstorm?  &#10; • Did they make a bullet plan?  &#10; • Did they write at least five sentences using the plan and the brainstorming? Do the  &#10; sentences reflect descriptive writing?  &#10; • Did they capitalize the first word of each sentence? Is there end punctuation?  &#10; • Does each sentence make sense?  &#10; • Is there use of figurative language?   &#10; • Did they use adjectives, adverbs, and action verbs effectively?  &#10; Use the rubric to assess their writing. Although your students’ writing may not look exactly  &#10; like this, you will have a general idea of what is acceptable and what isn’t. &#10; ]]></text>

Summary  &#10; In the video, you learned the keyword for descriptive writing is describe. When you see this  &#10; word in directions, you will know you need to describe.   &#10; Mr. Butler helped you brainstorm ways to describe a watch. Mr. Butler made a plan for  &#10; describing. He used bullets as a way to organize the plan. Sentence by sentence, Mr. Butler  &#10; modeled complete sentences that described the watch. Finally, Mr. Butler revised and edited  &#10; the paragraph.  &#10; Your Turn!  &#10; Using the modeled piece of writing, you should write your own descriptive paragraph about  &#10; an object of your choice. The object can be anything around you. Be sure to follow the  &#10; process of brainstorming, planning, writing, and revising and editing as Mr. Butler did  &#10; during the lesson.  &#10; ]]></text>

2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual  &#10; RUBRIC &#10; Exceeds Standards:  &#10; The bright blue coffee mug patiently sits on the granite counter awaiting its normal brew.  &#10; As I step into the kitchen, a beeping alerts me that my coffee is ready. I pour the dark roast  &#10; into my cup, careful not to let the level reach the rim. Reaching into the refrigerator, I  &#10; produce a carafe of vanilla creme and pour a helping into the cup causing the dark coffee  &#10; to morph into a light tan.  &#10; Meets Standards:  &#10; My blue coffee mug sits on the kitchen counter waiting for me to fill it up. When I go into  &#10; the kitchen, I hear the beeping noise of my coffee maker. I grab the pot and pour myself a  &#10; cup. I stop it before it reaches the top so I can pour in the delicious vanilla creamer. The  &#10; second I pour it in, my dark coffee turns tan. &#10; Below Standards:  &#10; my blue coffee cup is in the kitchen   i put coffee in it and I drink it it is good.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; Understanding the skills are quite different from the application of skills. When understanding  &#10; meets application, I call that a “click.” It’s like a puzzle piece finding its companion.   &#10; In this activity, the application of the writing process is the click. When your students apply  &#10; the process viewed in the modeling video to their own writing, they will understand how  &#10; following the process removes frustration from their writing. &#10; ]]></text>

A noun can be a person, place, thing, or  &#10; idea. Proper nouns are nouns that are specific. They use a person’s name or the  &#10; name of a company or organization for example. They are capitalized.  &#10; Person: girl, teacher, Mr. Watson, the Attorney General  &#10; Place: a field, grocery store, Target, Oregon   &#10; Thing: cat, bed, Coke   &#10; Idea: love, fairness, Einstein's Theory of Relativity  &#10; A noun can function as the subject of the sentence (doing the action), as  &#10; the object (having the action done to it), or as an object of a preposition.   &#10; Billy (subject) accidentally hit Bob (object).  &#10; A preposition is another part of speech. Its purpose is to show where something  &#10; is or when it happened. Words like in, between, before, and since are  &#10; prepositions. Nouns are used as the object of the preposition.  &#10; Billy (subject) accidentally hit Bob (object) in the face (object of the preposition). &#10; ]]></text>

2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual  &#10; ASSESSMENT  &#10; Conventions covers punctuation, grammar, and spelling. It is one of the six traits of writing  &#10; and commonly part of analytical assessment scoring.   &#10; In Weekly Writer, the instructional videos focus on holistic content writing first and editing for  &#10; punctuation, grammar, and spelling at the end of the writing process. Students need to focus  &#10; on first on their content. If the content of the writing isn’t sound, then there is little need to  &#10; edit. By nature, language arts teachers want to edit first for conventions, but if the student  &#10; has to go back and rewrite sentences for content, then they feel like they’ve wasted their  &#10; efforts.   &#10; Therefore, it is important for you to focus on the content of their writing as a primary goal.  &#10; When the content is firm, then ask the student to edit for punctuation, grammar, and  &#10; spelling.   &#10; In Conventions, the goal is to make basic punctuation and grammar second nature to the  &#10; student writer. Consider these basics:  &#10; • Capitalize the first word of a sentence  &#10; • Capitalize the word “I”  &#10; • Capitalize proper nouns  &#10; • Add end punctuation for a statement, a question, or exclamation  &#10; Next, focus on —  &#10; • Subject and verb agreement  &#10; • Is the sentence a complete thought?  &#10; This week the lesson focuses on nouns. Although this is a basic grammar skill, many junior  &#10; high students struggle with identifying the noun in a sentence as well as its purpose. The  &#10; Checking for Understanding activity gives you a great platform to discuss nouns in student  &#10; writing. &#10; ]]></text>

2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual  &#10; This is a great group activity for an interactive white board. Feel free to print out the activity  &#10; sheet and let the students do it on their own or with a partner. This activity can also be  &#10; projected on your interactive white board or viewed on a tablet or computer with the  &#10; students answering on notebook paper.  &#10; As teachers, we believe the recognition of nouns in a sentence should be easy for an eighth  &#10; grader. However, that is not always the case. They struggle with the difference in “noun” and  &#10; “subject.” The subject of the sentence is a noun, but there are other nouns in the sentence.   &#10; This activity will help you promote the recognition of nouns under differing circumstances.   &#10; As you work through the week, ask your students to identify nouns in their own writing.   &#10; Each time you write with your eighth graders, take the time to analyze the structure of each  &#10; sentence. Consider diagramming a sentence to help your students understand the structure  &#10; and organization.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; For this Conventions lesson to click, you will have help connect the pieces. As described  &#10; above, your constant modeling of pointing out different uses of nouns.   &#10; Many times we assume our students understand because no one is raising their hand.  &#10; However, consider the possibility that you have students who are afraid to raise their hands  &#10; for fear of being ridiculed. On the surface, a noun seems like a very simple thing to  &#10; recognize, but you may have to connect the dots for them.    &#10; This concept will be a constant “click” each time you write. As you observe your students, be  &#10; mindful of those who master this concept and those who need more attention.  &#10; ]]></text>

The Character Book   &#10; Complete all three activities to start building a library of characters. It is important to have  &#10; detailed information on each character. You will also be creating worlds for these characters  &#10; to live in - their settings.  &#10; By building a Character Book, you will have a library of characters and their worlds to pull  &#10; from each time you write a narrative.  You will use these characters and their worlds over and  &#10; over. Just like an author who writes a series of books like Harry Potter or The Hunger Games,  &#10; you will be quite familiar with the characters and their voices. By doing this, you will be able  &#10; to take any narrative prompt and short-cut the planning process to write narratives under  &#10; timed conditions.  &#10; Activity #1  &#10; When you write stories, you need characters to write about. Fill out the character worksheet  &#10; based on yourself.  &#10; Activity #2  &#10; Create another character you completely make up. Make them your age and someone you  &#10; with whom you would like to be friends.  &#10; Activity #3  &#10; Create another character that is completely opposite of yourself.  &#10; For each character you create, place a Character Worksheet in your Writer’s Workbook. When  &#10; you write a narrative, use them to help you write.  &#10; To fill out a Character Worksheet, answer each of the questions. Use the box to draw a  &#10; picture or paste a picture of your character. &#10; ]]></text>

ASSESSMENT  &#10; This is an ongoing activity for the student. Make multiple copies of The Character Worksheet  &#10; and place them in an easily accessible spot in your classroom.   &#10; When a student has an idea for a character, they can fill out a Character Worksheet and add  &#10; it to their Writer’s Workbook. I like to see eighth graders develop the following types of  &#10; characters:  &#10; • Main Characters - These are characters the student wants to use as the main focus of a  &#10; story.  &#10; • Allies - These are friends of the main character  &#10; • Opponents - These are good and bad opponents.  Good opponents are teachers,  &#10; parents, and friends who have the best interest of the main character at heart. Bad  &#10; opponents are bullies or other bad guys in their stories.  &#10; • Ally-Opponent OR Opponent-Ally - These are characters who begin as one type of  &#10; character but develop into another due to the circumstances of the story.  &#10; I highly suggest developing some classroom characters for the entire class to write about in  &#10; your modeling lessons. I have seen amazing examples of how teachers have used classroom  &#10; characters to reinforce character education concepts through narratives they wrote in  &#10; modeling activities. Make these classroom characters part of your classroom family.   &#10; There is an example included in the answer key of how an eighth grader might fill out the  &#10; Character Worksheet. As you review their choices, encourage them to make their character  &#10; their age and grade. There is nothing wrong with having a variety of ages as they develop  &#10; additional characters, but for the time being, they should create about what they know in  &#10; their world.  &#10; ]]></text>

The question that pops into the minds of most teachers is, “Why are we doing a narrative  &#10; activity while we’re working on descriptive?” Fair question. Although writing has been broken  &#10; down into “modes” of writing, I firmly believe students must learn how to divide and  &#10; conquer! They must be prepared to write in any mode or mix the modes at any time. Do we  &#10; not describe in a narrative or possibly in a science or social studies question? Use this activity  &#10; to build awareness and observational skills with your students. Allow this to transfer into  &#10; other curricular areas as well.  &#10; In the descriptive sentences, make sure your students are not explaining details about the  &#10; character. In other words, if they write — Everyone loves her because she smiles all the time.  &#10; — point out that this is explaining “why” they like her. Notice how I reversed the same  &#10; concept by letting the character have the action. She smiles all the time, and everyone loves  &#10; her.  I deleted the word “because” and used the action verbs “smile” and “loves” to show  &#10; instead of tell or explain.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; Allow this activity to click into multiple activities. Imagine your students filling out a Character  &#10; Worksheet on another classmate, or a character from a novel they are reading, or a character  &#10; from a story in your reading series.   &#10; As for their own work,  students need to start building a collection of character worksheets  &#10; for their narrative writing. Don’t let this one be the only one they do. Encourage your  &#10; students to do several of these over a period of time.   &#10; Additionally, the Character Worksheet asks the students to be observant about what they see  &#10; in their imaginations, and they have to describe as well. This is an excellent opportunity for  &#10; you to drive home the message about descriptive not being just the sense of “seeing.”  &#10; Describing must include all of the senses and emotions to be well-rounded.  &#10; ]]></text>

      <text><![CDATA[RIP & Write &#10; *Remember, RIP stands for “Read, Interpret, Predict”  &#10; Reading to comprehend is a skill all to itself. Often, students skim and scan a passage and  &#10; call that reading. Skimming and scanning is a wonderful skill to get an idea of what the  &#10; passage is about, however, it never replaces close reading. When you close read a passage  &#10; you will discover details and inferences in the words.   &#10; RIP is a reading strategy to help you close read a passage. As you read the math word  &#10; problem, you will be guided through the RIP strategy.  &#10; Tornado Sirens  &#10; Read  &#10; Read a short portion of the text. As you read, remember to stop at the periods. Picture  &#10; what’s happening in your imagination. Read with expression even if you are reading in your  &#10; mind!  &#10;   The city has just installed new tornado sirens in strategic locations  &#10; throughout the city to help keep everyone safe in the event of severe weather.  &#10; The sirens are on 65 foot poles. Workers attach four guy-wires to stakes in the  &#10; ground 30 feet from the pole.  &#10; Interpret  &#10; We’re not finished reading the passage, but let’s stop and interpret by asking some  &#10; questions.  &#10; • What is the subject of the problem?   &#10; • How do you know it’s a math problem? What context clues tell you this?  &#10; • Is “guy-wire” a real term? What do you picture in your mind when you hear this term?  &#10; Predict  &#10; • Is a guy-wire a wire that holds up a pole?   &#10; • Is the problem going to ask me to determine how much guy-wire they need?  &#10; ]]></text>

As  &#10; your students are learning the strategy, model it with them. Each element of the strategy is  &#10; key to building reading comprehension. There is nothing wrong with skimming and scanning  &#10; to get a general idea, but it should never replace close reading.  &#10; GUIDE  &#10; As you guide students through this lesson, point out that after reading these sentences, a red  &#10; flag should pop up. This sounds and feels like a math lesson. Watch out! Which information is  &#10; important? In your mind, convert the number words to digits and start predicting what math  &#10; operation you will have to do.  &#10;    &#10; Additionally, take notice of the descriptive language - new, strategic, severe.  Is it odd to find  &#10; descriptive language in a math problem? Did you think of these words as being descriptive?   &#10; Now that we know it’s a math problem, let’s be on the lookout for additional information we  &#10; may need to solve a potential problem.  &#10; Keep reading —  &#10;   Each guy-wire has a length of 45 feet. Approximately how far up the pole will the guywires  &#10; be attached? &#10; ]]></text>

Approximately how far up the pole  &#10; will the guy-wires be attached?  &#10;    &#10; Interpret  &#10; We’re finished reading the passage.

Did you see the question in the instructions. Now, let’s try to fully understand what the  &#10; question is asking us to do. It will be important to use logical thinking as well as our  &#10; knowledge and ideas from math to determine which approach we should use to solve the  &#10; problem.   &#10; The instructions are clear. We are going to plug in the given information to the Pythagorean  &#10; Theorem since the guy-wires will form right triangles to the base of the poles. The height the  &#10; guy-wires will be attached up the pole will represent a2 (which is unknown) and the distance  &#10; they are staked in the ground will represent b2. The length of the wire will represent c2. When  &#10; these are plugged into the Pythagorean Theorem you get a2 + 900 = 2015. Once that  &#10; equation is solved for a, the answer is the guide wires will be attached approximately 33.5  &#10; feet up the pole.   &#10; As you guide your students through the RIP & Write lesson, you are clearly modeling the  &#10; process step by step. You are not only building reading comprehension skills, but you are  &#10; building logical thinking skills. Too often, we focus on “thinking out of the box,” and  &#10; forgetting that students need logical, common sense thinking skills as well. There is nothing  &#10; difficult about this problem if you look at it from a logical perspective.   &#10; When you answer the open-ended questions, be sure to model how students should answer  &#10; in a complete sentence.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; During the week, we have talked about nouns. In math, it is important to answer open-ended  &#10; questions with a complete sentence expressing the answer with details. And, it is important  &#10; that students can recognize nouns in their own writing.   &#10; Use this opportunity to talk about the parallel of sentence variety in language arts to  &#10; sentence variety in math.  &#10; Before they write their answers to the open-ended sentences, consider the purpose of each  &#10; sentence. &#10; ]]></text>

Over the next few weeks,  &#10; we will break down the process for you step by step. Our goal is to learn how to RIP the  &#10; passages for close reading, find the details needed to answer the questions,  and learn how  &#10; to write the answers in our own words. It will also be necessary to cite where you found the  &#10; answer. The word “cite” means to give credit to the source where you found the answer.   &#10; A Rainy Afternoon  &#10;   Drip, drop. Drip, drop. The pitter patter of rain colliding with the tin roof causes  &#10; goosebumps to rise on my arms. A strong scent of rain in the air consumes me. I shudder at  &#10; the dampness in the air but have no desire to retreat into my house. The serenity of my  &#10; porch swing suits me. As the rain beats like a drum, it speaks to me, carrying me away into a  &#10; relaxing slumber.  &#10; Did you RIP the passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued,  &#10; what do you think would happen next?  &#10; Rain  &#10; Wikipedia  &#10; Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water  &#10; vapor and then precipitated—that is, become heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a  &#10; major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh  &#10; water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as  &#10; water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.  &#10; Did you RIP this passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued,  &#10; what do you think would happen next?  &#10; ]]></text>

      <text><![CDATA[Let’s Source Write   &#10; Step one in source writing is understanding. If you have read the two passages, you are  &#10; aware of how different they are. One is a descriptive passage and one is an explanatory  &#10; passage. How do you know that?   &#10; The Approaching Storm is written from the author’s viewpoint and describes what the  &#10; author sees, hears, and feels as a storm develops. Clouds, Storms, and Rain gives you  &#10; information about the elements in a storm. Notice the credit to Wikipedia, an online free  &#10; encyclopedia.   &#10; The next step is to answer the following questions in one or two sentences. This will help  &#10; you determine if you RIP’ed the passages to clearly understand details, structure, and your  &#10; own interpretation as it relates to you.  &#10; Answer, Reply, or Instruction  &#10; Answer the following questions in one or two sentences. To the best of your ability, give credit to the  &#10; passage where you found the information. Refer to the passage by its title.  &#10; For example — In A Rainy Afternoon, the onomatopoeia enables the reader to hear the rain falling.   When  &#10; you use the title in your answer, you are giving credit to the passage.  &#10; Your turn!  &#10; 1. In your opinion, does the author of the passage like the rain?  Use evidence from the  &#10; passage to support your opinion.  &#10; 2. Where does rain come from? Use information from the passage to explain in detail.   &#10; 3. Write two additional descriptive sentences to continue the descriptive passage, A Rainy  &#10; Afternoon. Be sure to stay in the same style and voice as the author.  &#10; ]]></text>

Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom ©  &#10; In your activity, students are asked to locate details from the passage and answer openended  &#10; questions based on information and inference. If they did not RIP the passage, it is  &#10; possible they only skimmed and scanned. The result will be frustrating to them; they will have  &#10; no clue how to answer the questions.   &#10; The first question asks them to state their opinion about whether or not the author likes the  &#10; rain. The evidence to support the answer is there, but the student must understand the  &#10; inference and description of feeling to draw this conclusion.   &#10; The second question asks the student to draw from the informational passage. To do so, they  &#10; must understand the passage and be able to reference information in their response.   &#10; Finally, students are asked to write two additional sentences about the beating drum and the  &#10; rain carrying the author away into a slumber. Guide your students to utilize the writing  &#10; process of brainstorming, planning, writing, and revising and editing to create these two  &#10; sentences. If they are having trouble with this, you may have to model it for them in a group  &#10; activity and then ask them to write two descriptive sentences on their own.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; In Source Writing, students have to utilize the skills they have learned during the week. They  &#10; have to:  &#10; • Read to comprehend using the RIP strategy  &#10; • Use the writing process to answer open-ended questions  &#10; • Use comprehension skills to identify details and information as well as draw conclusions  &#10; • Write in complete sentences using a variety of sentences  &#10; Each step of the way, you are making “clicks” for your students. Help them to make these  &#10; connections. It may seem obvious to you and to me, but our student writers need you to  &#10; connect the dots. By doing this, they will begin to do this independently as they write on  &#10; their own.  &#10; ]]></text>
