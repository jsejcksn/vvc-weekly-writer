Through observation, you can assess prior knowledge of your  &#10; students. As we begin our lessons in Weekly Writer, it is important to set goals and prepare  &#10; for vertical alignment with first grade.   &#10; Introduce and Make It Fun!  &#10; In the beginning of the year, the goal should be to introduce the concept of writing and to  &#10; make it fun. The first day of kindergarten is where the foundation for writing begins. You may  &#10; be asking yourself, &#8220;How is that possible?&#8221; We do not expect your young students to write  &#10; sentences &#8212; at least not yet. The foundations for writing are built with reading, discussion,  &#10; and modeling. All of the lessons in Weekly Writer will be teacher led and teacher directed,  &#10; at least through the first semester.   &#10; Testing the Waters  &#10; By the end of the sixteenth week, you will have some students who are ready to build basic  &#10; sentences. Let them. Encourage them. But, do not apply stress to produce. The voices of  &#10; past English teachers will command that every sentence have a level of perfection, and you  &#10; will have to continually remind yourself that these are five year olds. Reward their content  &#10; writing and encourage the application of skills you have taught in grammar and punctuation.  &#10; End of the Year  &#10; At the end of kindergarten, students should be able to:   &#10; &#8226; Identify different types of writing &#8212; descriptive, narrative, explanatory, and opinion writing.  &#10; &#8226; Write one or more basic sentences in each of the modes of writing.  &#10; &#8226; Respond to questions from one or more sources in written form.  &#10; Assessment is ongoing. It is behind the scenes through observation and present in their  &#10; writing. Use the first few weeks to lay the ground work. At the beginning of the fourth week,  &#10; you will begin an observation journal for diagnostic assessment of your students. &#10; Go to the next page to watch this week&#8217;s video. &#10;
