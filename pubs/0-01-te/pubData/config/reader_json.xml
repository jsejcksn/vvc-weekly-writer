When we describe, we let the reader  &#10; experience something. It may be a thing, a place, a person, or something that happens.   &#10; To describe, we need to ask questions.  &#10; Let’s use our senses to ask great questions:  &#10; • What do you see?  &#10; • What do you hear?   &#10; • What do you smell?  &#10; • What do you taste?  &#10; • How does it feel to touch?  &#10; • How does it make you feel inside?  &#10; The last question pulls on our emotions. Writing about how we feel gives great voice and  &#10; expression to our writing.   &#10; To learn more about writing in the descriptive mode, watch the writing lesson with Mr. Butler  &#10; and RIP!  &#10; In the video, Mr. Butler will walk you through the writing process of brainstorming,  &#10; planning, writing, and revising and editing.  &#10; "},{"text":"Let’s Write!  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

Through observation, you can assess prior knowledge of your  &#10; students. As we begin our lessons in Weekly Writer, it is important to set goals and prepare  &#10; for vertical alignment with first grade.   &#10; Introduce and Make It Fun!  &#10; In the beginning of the year, the goal should be to introduce the concept of writing and to  &#10; make it fun. The first day of kindergarten is where the foundation for writing begins. You may  &#10; be asking yourself, “How is that possible?” We do not expect your young students to write  &#10; sentences — at least not yet. The foundations for writing are built with reading, discussion,  &#10; and modeling. All of the lessons in Weekly Writer will be teacher led and teacher directed,  &#10; at least through the first semester.   &#10; Testing the Waters  &#10; By the end of the sixteenth week, you will have some students who are ready to build basic  &#10; sentences. Let them. Encourage them. But, do not apply stress to produce. The voices of  &#10; past English teachers will command that every sentence have a level of perfection, and you  &#10; will have to continually remind yourself that these are five year olds. Reward their content  &#10; writing and encourage the application of skills you have taught in grammar and punctuation.  &#10; End of the Year  &#10; At the end of kindergarten, students should be able to:   &#10; • Identify different types of writing — descriptive, narrative, explanatory, and opinion writing.  &#10; • Write one or more basic sentences in each of the modes of writing.  &#10; • Respond to questions from one or more sources in written form.  &#10; Assessment is ongoing.

SUMMARY  &#10; In the video, Mr. Butler and RIP described an apple. He used a graphic organizer called a  &#10; web to brainstorm for ideas. Brainstorming is thinking of many, different ideas. Next, Mr.  &#10; Butler made a plan to write his sentences. As he wrote each sentence, he built it out loud to  &#10; organize the words so the sentence would make sense. Then, he wrote the words on the  &#10; board to create complete sentences. Finally, Mr. Butler and RIP read the sentences to look for  &#10; mistakes. They corrected their mistakes so the reader could read them without any problems.   &#10; YOUR TURN!  &#10; Think about a banana! Use the same steps Mr. Butler and RIP used to write about the apple  &#10; to describe a banana. First, you need to brainstorm. Next, you need to make a plan. Then,  &#10; you need to write your sentence or sentences. When you are finished, you need to revise and  &#10; edit for mistakes.   &#10; Your teacher will guide you through the writing process to create an amazing description of a  &#10; banana!  &#10; "},{"text":"Let’s Write!  &#10;

RUBRIC &#10; Exceeds Standards:  &#10;   The banana is yellow like butter.

The inside is soft. &#10; Below Standards:  &#10; i like bananas &#10; CLICK  &#10; This is your first introduction to the writing process. Ask your students to think about other  &#10; things in their lives requiring a process, or steps — tying their shoes, brushing their teeth,  &#10; washing their hands. Use the banana prompt to model the writing process just as Mr. Butler  &#10; did in the video. Your goal is to write one or more sentences as a group based on the  &#10; students’ brainstorming and planning. Utilize the revising and editing to teach the period  &#10; and capitalizing the first word of a sentence.  &#10; "},{"text":"Conventions &#10; Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom ©  &#10;

Sentences That Tell  &#10; Some sentences ask questions, some sentences show excitement, and others simply tell  &#10; something. Today we will talk about sentences that tell.   &#10; Sentences must begin with a capital letter. If a sentence tells something, it should end with a  &#10; period.  &#10; Let’s look at some sentences that tell.   &#10; • I like to read books.   &#10; • My favorite food is pizza.   &#10; • My dog is brown.   &#10; • I live in a house.   &#10; • I like to eat chocolate ice cream.  &#10; "},{"text":"Conventions  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10; Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom ©  &#10;

ASSESSMENT  &#10; During the writing lesson with Mr. Butler and RIP, the concept of capitalization of the first  &#10; word of a sentence and end punctuation was introduced. As you write with your students  &#10; about the banana, use a lowercase letter for the first word of your sentence or sentences and  &#10; leave out end punctuation.  &#10; First, see if any student realizes the mistakes on their own. If they don’t, ask, “Is there  &#10; anything we need to do to revise and edit our sentence(s)? Hopefully, the answer will be  &#10; “yes,\" and you will continue the lesson revising and editing. If the answer is “no,” you will  &#10; need to prod them by referring to the video.   &#10; In this Conventions lesson, you have the opportunity to go one step further and teach your  &#10; kindergarteners about sentences that tell. You will continue the lesson on capitalizing the first  &#10; word of a sentence and the necessity of a period for end punctuation in a sentence that tells.  &#10; Although most students are not expected to read what you write at this point, modeling in  &#10; this way lays a foundation for literacy for students.   &#10; Gauge student understanding as you complete the Checking for Understanding page in  &#10; whole or small group. This lesson generally takes ten minutes, and we highly encourage you  &#10; to utilize your interactive white board or the projection of this page onto a white board for  &#10; the lesson.   &#10; This page can be printed, and students can add period to the end of each sentence if you  &#10; feel they are developmentally ready to do so. However, it is recommended that this lesson  &#10; be a group lesson led by the classroom teacher.  &#10; Go to the next page for checking for understanding of this week’s conventions. &#10; "},{"text":"CHECKING FOR UNDERSTANDING  &#10; In whole or small group, read the sentences for your students.

lesson. Our goals are —  &#10; • Introduce telling sentences  &#10; • Introduce the period at the end of telling sentences  &#10; • Introduce capitalizing the first word of a sentence  &#10; Even though Mr. Butler and RIP introduced these concepts in the video, it is important for  &#10; you to continue the implementation of these skills into your group writing lessons. As Mr.  &#10; Butler models and you model, the students will begin their journey of not only understanding  &#10; the rules of grammar and punctuation, but they will practice the application of these skills in  &#10; their own writing. &#10; "},{"text":"Application &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

In fact, it is a special type of telling  &#10; because the reader has descriptive details. In our Let’s Write lesson with Mr. Butler and RIP,  &#10; we learned how to use our senses to describe. How would you use your senses to describe?  &#10; I see a dog  &#10; That’s not very juicy. Can we take out the word see? What is the dog doing? How about —  &#10; Make it better!:  &#10; The dog ran.  &#10; In this sentence the dog is doing something. We know he ran because we saw him run. We  &#10; didn’t need to say I see.  &#10; Now, let’s add some juicy words!  &#10; Stretch it!:  &#10; The brown dog ran across my yard.   &#10; In this sentence, we learn the color of the dog. We learn what the dog is doing, and we learn  &#10; where he is running. &#10; "},{"text":"Application  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

ASSESSMENT  &#10; Children want to write I see, I hear, I smell, I taste, I touch, I feel, I like, and I love. This is very  &#10; basic, and there is nothing wrong with it. However, from this point, there needs to be a  &#10; progression to something more substantial. We need to create stronger sentences that infer  &#10; seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, feeling, liking, and loving without using those  &#10; words all the time.   &#10; In the Apply It lesson, we will be focusing on seeing and hearing. In whole group, write a  &#10; new sentence that infers seeing or hearing. Then, revise the sentence (stretch it) to include  &#10; juicy descriptive words.  &#10; Utilize observation assessment to determine the level of understanding.  &#10; Go to the next page for the “apply it!” section of this week’s application. &#10;

Before he wrote a new sentence, Mr. Butler played with the words in the air until he found  &#10; the right words to make a sentence. Then, Mr. Butler added juicy descriptive words to make  &#10; the sentence stronger. He stretched it!  &#10; For the Application lesson, you will remind students of this as you build the first sentence  &#10; that does away with the word see or hear and replaces it with inference or telling. This week,  &#10; we have referred to descriptive details as “juicy words.” Mr. Butler will use this term quite  &#10; often. He is, of course, referring to adjectives, action verbs, adverbs, and figurative language.  &#10; As we move through the weeks, you will have individual lessons on each of these.  &#10; "},{"text":"RIP & Write &#10;

Which words in the passage tell us?  &#10; Predict  &#10; • I think Gigi will get tired of eating bananas.  &#10; • I think she will get in trouble.  &#10; • I think we will count how many bananas Gigi eats a day. &#10;

GUIDE  &#10; Obviously, this is a guided reading lesson. This is another opportunity for you to model  &#10; reading with expression, a fluent rate, and how you connect words together in a sentence  &#10; when you read.   &#10; This is the first time you will introduce the RIP close reading strategy. There is no need to go  &#10; into explanation with your students about the strategy. They will learn it naturally by you  &#10; modeling it with them. We highly recommend you doing this across the board in every  &#10; content area, every time you read. With that said, we understand that as you are teaching  &#10; your students to read, you will have exercises that must be read from beginning to end  &#10; without stopping. Use RIP whenever possible to sow the seeds of reading comprehension  &#10; skills.  &#10; As you interpret and predict, refer back to the passage for details to support your answers  &#10; and predictions.  &#10;

In Conventions,  &#10; we went a little further into the rules of writing sentences that tell with a capital letter in the  &#10; beginning and a period at the end. In Application, we applied our new writing skill and our  &#10; conventions skills.   &#10; In RIP & Write, we introduced the RIP close reading strategy and answered questions with  &#10; sentences that tell. In fact, our passage this week was actually a math problem. This was your  &#10; opportunity to plant the seed in their minds that reading and writing are not just language  &#10; arts subjects — they are included in every subject.  &#10; "},{"text":"Source Writing &#10;

As you read the passages for your students, model great expression, a  &#10; fluent rate, and observe punctuation marks.  &#10; “Climbing the Apple Tree”  &#10;   The other day, I climbed an apple tree. The big branches seemed to reach the sky!  &#10; Dozens of bright red, juicy apples hung from the limbs. I sat on a limb and took a bite of an  &#10; apple. Crunch! Apple juice rolled down my cheek. Every bite was delicious.  &#10; Did you RIP the passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued,  &#10; what do you think would happen next?  &#10; Johnny Appleseed  &#10;   There is a tall tale of a man named Johnny who planted apple trees. He traveled to  &#10; many states and planted apple trees. His real name was John Chapman, but everyone called  &#10; him Johnny Appleseed. He cared deeply for animals as well.   &#10; Did you RIP this passage? What kind of questions did you ask?

ASSESSMENT  &#10; One passage is narrative with descriptive detail, and the other passage is informational with  &#10; only a hint of description. It is important for your children to see the need for descriptive  &#10; detail in every mode of writing.  &#10; As you read the passages, RIP them by reading only a sentence or two at a time.

CLICK  &#10; Even though we have not approached narrative or explanatory, kindergarteners have a good  &#10; foundation in stories, and they understand the concept of explaining. In our Conventions  &#10; lesson, we talked about sentences that tell. These types of sentences appear in all modes of  &#10; writing, but in an informational passage such as “Johnny Appleseed,” it is obvious that the  &#10; reader is learning information about John Chapman.   &#10; As you read the passages with your students, make connections for them with the RIP  &#10; strategy and how helpful it is to answer questions after reading.   &#10; It is the end of the week. How did it go? Looking ahead to next week, what will you do the  &#10; same? What will you do differently?  &#10;
