If you are asked to write in the descriptive mode, you will see the word describe in the  &#10; prompt or instructions. This is called a keyword. The keyword directs you to what kind of  &#10; writing you are supposed to do.  &#10; Describing is like painting pictures with words in the mind of the reader. When we describe,  &#10; we let the reader experience something. It may be a thing, a place, a person, or something  &#10; that happens.   &#10; To describe, we start by brainstorming. Let’s use our senses to ask great questions.  &#10; 1. What do you see?  &#10; 2. What do you hear?   &#10; 3. What do you smell?  &#10; 4. What do you taste?  &#10; 5. How does it feel to touch?  &#10; 6. How does it make you feel inside?  &#10; This last question pulls on your emotions. Writing about how you feel gives great voice and  &#10; expression to your writing.   &#10; Once you have finished brainstorming, you will make a plan. From the plan, you will write.  &#10; After you have a paragraph, you will revise and edit.  &#10; In the video, Mr. Butler will walk you through the writing process of brainstorming,  &#10; planning, writing, and revising and editing.  &#10;

Summary  &#10; In the video, you learned the keyword for descriptive writing is describe. When you see this  &#10; word in directions, you will know you need to describe.   &#10; Mr. Butler helped you brainstorm ways to describe a toy. Mr. Butler made a plan for  &#10; describing. He used bullets as a way to organize the plan. Sentence by sentence, Mr. Butler  &#10; modeled complete sentences that described the toy. Finally, Mr. Butler revised and edited  &#10; the paragraph.  &#10; Your Turn!  &#10; Using the modeled piece of writing, you should write your own descriptive paragraph about  &#10; a toy. The toy can be one from your younger years or a toy you play with currently. Be sure to  &#10; follow the process of brainstorming, planning, writing, and revising and editing as Mr.  &#10; Butler did during the lesson. &#10; "},{"text":"Conventions &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

Use as much descriptive language as possible to paint pictures with  &#10; words.   &#10; Activity #2  &#10; Create another character you completely make up! Make them your age and someone you  &#10; would like to be friends with.  &#10; Activity #3  &#10; Write a descriptive paragraph about each of the characters you have created. Be sure to use  &#10; your writing process to create these paragraphs. Brainstorm, plan, write, and revise and edit  &#10; your descriptive writing.   &#10; Place your completed Character Worksheets in your Writer’s Workbook.
