		Let&#8217;s Source Write   &#10; Step one in source writing is understanding. If you have read the two passages, you are  &#10; aware of how different they are. One is a descriptive passage and one is an explanatory  &#10; passage. How do you know that?   &#10; The Approaching Storm is written from the author&#8217;s viewpoint and describes what the  &#10; author sees, hears, and feels as a storm develops. Clouds, Storms, and Rain gives you  &#10; information about the elements in a storm. Notice the credit to Wikipedia, an online free  &#10; encyclopedia.   &#10; The next step is to answer the following questions in one or two sentences. This will help  &#10; you determine if you RIP&#8217;ed the passages to clearly understand details, structure, and your  &#10; own interpretation as it relates to you.  &#10; Your turn!  &#10; Answer the following questions in one or two sentences. To the best of your ability, give  &#10; credit to the passage where you found the information. Refer to the passage by its title.  &#10; For example &#8212; In The Approaching Storm, the squirrel was scared because of the thunder.   &#10; When you use the title in your answer, you are giving credit to the passage.   &#10; 1. Do you think the author of &#8220;The Approaching Storm&#8221; likes or dislikes storms? Use  &#10; information from the passage to support your opinion.  &#10; 2. How do you think a storm can affect the surface of our planet? Use information from the  &#10; passage to explain the good and bad effects of a storm.   &#10;     &#10; 3.  Why do think the author of the descriptive passage stated that he/she felt the trees were  &#10; bowing to them? Use information from the passage to draw a conclusion and explain your  &#10; thoughts.  &#10;   &#10;
