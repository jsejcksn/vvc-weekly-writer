		RIP &#38; Write &#10; *Remember, RIP stands for &#8220;Read, Interpret, Predict&#8221;  &#10; Reading to comprehend is a skill all to itself. Often, students skim and scan a passage and  &#10; call that reading. Skimming and scanning is a wonderful skill to get an idea of what the  &#10; passage is about, however, it never replaces close reading. When you close read a passage  &#10; you will discover details and inferences in the words.   &#10; RIP is a reading strategy to help you close read a passage. As you read the math word  &#10; problem, you will be guided through the RIP strategy.   &#10; September Birthday  &#10; Read  &#10; Read a short portion of the text. As you read, remember to stop at the periods. Picture  &#10; what&#8217;s happening in your imagination. Read with expression even if you are reading in your  &#10; mind!  &#10;   September is the best month ever. The sun is out, the flowers have  &#10; bloomed, and my birthday is on September 15th! My mother said I could have  &#10; five friends over for a party. We will have chips, cupcakes, and pizza to eat.  &#10; Interpret  &#10; We&#8217;re not finished reading the passage, but let&#8217;s stop and interpret by asking some  &#10; questions.  &#10; &#8226; What is the passage about?  &#10; &#8226; What clues tell me this will be a math word problem?  &#10; &#8226; What information could be important to a math problem?   &#10; Predict  &#10; &#8226; What kind of math could I have to do?  &#10; &#8226; Will the math problem ask me to find out how much pizza to order?  &#10;
