Many people  &#10; associate descriptive writing with narrative, since stories must be layered with description to  &#10; create visual images in the minds of the reader. As a writer, you will learn that descriptive  &#10; writing is not limited to narrative. It will be in every type of writing you do.  &#10; Aside from the narrative, explanatory, and argumentative modes of writing, descriptive can  &#10; stand alone as its own mode of writing. The writer is the observer, capturing what they see,  &#10; hear, smell, taste, touch, and feel inside.  In this case, descriptives are best written in first  &#10; person and in present tense.   &#10; If you are asked to write in the descriptive mode, you will see the word describe in the  &#10; prompt or instructions. This is called a keyword. The keyword directs you to what kind of  &#10; writing you are supposed to do.  &#10; Describing is like painting pictures with words in the mind of the reader. When we describe,  &#10; we let the reader experience something. It may be a thing, a place, a person, or something  &#10; that happens.   &#10; To describe, you start by brainstorming. Use your senses to ask great questions.  &#10; • What do you see?  &#10; • What do you hear?   &#10; • What do you smell?  &#10; • What do you taste?  &#10; • How does it feel to touch?  &#10; • How does it make you feel inside?  &#10; This last question pulls on your emotions. Writing about how you feel gives great voice and  &#10; expression to your writing.   &#10; In the video, Mr. Butler will walk you through the writing process of brainstorming,  &#10; planning, writing, and revising and editing.  &#10;

Summary  &#10; In the video, you learned the keyword for descriptive writing is describe. When you see this  &#10; word in directions, you will know you need to describe.   &#10; Mr. Butler helped you brainstorm ways to describe a watch. Mr. Butler made a plan for  &#10; describing. He used bullets as a way to organize the plan. Sentence by sentence, Mr. Butler  &#10; modeled complete sentences that described the watch. Finally, Mr. Butler revised and edited  &#10; the paragraph.  &#10; Your Turn!  &#10; Using the modeled piece of writing, you should write your own descriptive paragraph about  &#10; an object of your choice. The object can be anything around you. Be sure to follow the  &#10; process of brainstorming, planning, writing, and revising and editing as Mr. Butler did  &#10; during the lesson.  &#10; "},{"text":"Conventions &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

Nouns  &#10;     &#10; A noun is one of eight parts of speech. A noun can be a person, place, thing, or  &#10; idea. Proper nouns are nouns that are specific. They use a person’s name or the  &#10; name of a company or organization for example. They are capitalized.  &#10; Person: girl, teacher, Mr. Watson, the Attorney General  &#10; Place: a field, grocery store, Target, Oregon   &#10; Thing: cat, bed, Coke   &#10; Idea: love, fairness, Einstein's Theory of Relativity  &#10; A noun can function as the subject of the sentence (doing the action), as  &#10; the object (having the action done to it), or as an object of a preposition.   &#10; Billy (subject) accidentally hit Bob (object).  &#10; A preposition is another part of speech. Its purpose is to show where something  &#10; is or when it happened. Words like in, between, before, and since are  &#10; prepositions. Nouns are used as the object of the preposition.  &#10; Billy (subject) accidentally hit Bob (object) in the face (object of the preposition). &#10; "},{"text":"Checking for Understanding  &#10; Underline all the nouns in the following paragraph.

The Character Book   &#10; Complete all three activities to start building a library of characters. It is important to have  &#10; detailed information on each character. You will also be creating worlds for these characters  &#10; to live in - their settings.  &#10; By building a Character Book, you will have a library of characters and their worlds to pull  &#10; from each time you write a narrative.  You will use these characters and their worlds over and  &#10; over. Just like an author who writes a series of books like Harry Potter or The Hunger Games,  &#10; you will be quite familiar with the characters and their voices. By doing this, you will be able  &#10; to take any narrative prompt and short-cut the planning process to write narratives under  &#10; timed conditions.  &#10; Activity #1  &#10; When you write stories, you need characters to write about. Fill out the character worksheet  &#10; based on yourself.  &#10; Activity #2  &#10; Create another character you completely make up. Make them your age and someone you  &#10; with whom you would like to be friends.  &#10; Activity #3  &#10; Create another character that is completely opposite of yourself.  &#10; For each character you create, place a Character Worksheet in your Writer’s Workbook. When  &#10; you write a narrative, use them to help you write.  &#10; To fill out a Character Worksheet, answer each of the questions. Use the box to draw a  &#10; picture or paste a picture of your character. &#10; "},{"text":"APPLY IT!  &#10; Classroom2 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Village  &#10;

Often, students skim and scan a passage and  &#10; call that reading. Skimming and scanning is a wonderful skill to get an idea of what the  &#10; passage is about, however, it never replaces close reading. When you close read a passage  &#10; you will discover details and inferences in the words.   &#10; RIP is a reading strategy to help you close read a passage. As you read the math word  &#10; problem, you will be guided through the RIP strategy.  &#10; Tornado Sirens  &#10; Read  &#10; Read a short portion of the text.

What context clues tell you this?  &#10; • Is “guy-wire” a real term? What do you picture in your mind when you hear this term?  &#10; Predict  &#10; • Is a guy-wire a wire that holds up a pole?   &#10; • Is the problem going to ask me to determine how much guy-wire they need?  &#10; "},{"text":"Read  &#10; Let’s read the rest of the passage.

Over the next few weeks,  &#10; we will break down the process for you step by step. Our goal is to learn how to RIP the  &#10; passages for close reading, find the details needed to answer the questions,  and learn how  &#10; to write the answers in our own words. It will also be necessary to cite where you found the  &#10; answer. The word “cite” means to give credit to the source where you found the answer.   &#10; A Rainy Afternoon  &#10;   Drip, drop. Drip, drop. The pitter patter of rain colliding with the tin roof causes  &#10; goosebumps to rise on my arms. A strong scent of rain in the air consumes me. I shudder at  &#10; the dampness in the air but have no desire to retreat into my house. The serenity of my  &#10; porch swing suits me. As the rain beats like a drum, it speaks to me, carrying me away into a  &#10; relaxing slumber.  &#10; Did you RIP the passage? What kind of questions did you ask?

Rain is a  &#10; major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh  &#10; water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as  &#10; water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.  &#10; Did you RIP this passage?

Clouds, Storms, and Rain gives you  &#10; information about the elements in a storm.

To the best of your ability, give credit to the  &#10; passage where you found the information. Refer to the passage by its title.  &#10; For example — In A Rainy Afternoon, the onomatopoeia enables the reader to hear the rain falling.   When  &#10; you use the title in your answer, you are giving credit to the passage.  &#10; Your turn!  &#10; 1. In your opinion, does the author of the passage like the rain?
