		Source Writing &#10; Let&#8217;s take what we&#8217;ve learned this week in Let&#8217;s Write, Conventions, and RIP &#38; Write to do  &#10; some Source Writing!   &#10; Answering questions based on multiple sources can be difficult. Over the next few weeks,  &#10; we will break down the process for you step by step. Our goal is to learn how to RIP the  &#10; passages for close reading, find the details needed to answer the questions,  and learn how  &#10; to write the answers in our own words. It will also be necessary to cite where you found the  &#10; answer. The word &#8220;cite&#8221; means to give credit to the source where you found the answer.   &#10; A Rainy Afternoon  &#10;   Drip, drop. Drip, drop. The pitter patter of rain colliding with the tin roof causes  &#10; goosebumps to rise on my arms. A strong scent of rain in the air consumes me. I shudder at  &#10; the dampness in the air but have no desire to retreat into my house. The serenity of my  &#10; porch swing suits me. As the rain beats like a drum, it speaks to me, carrying me away into a  &#10; relaxing slumber.  &#10; Did you RIP the passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued,  &#10; what do you think would happen next?  &#10; Rain  &#10; Wikipedia  &#10; Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water  &#10; vapor and then precipitated&#8212;that is, become heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a  &#10; major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh  &#10; water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as  &#10; water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.  &#10; Did you RIP this passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued,  &#10; what do you think would happen next?  &#10;
