If you are asked to write in the descriptive mode, you will see the word describe in the  &#10; prompt or instructions. This is called a keyword. The keyword directs you to what kind of  &#10; writing you are supposed to do.  &#10; Describing is like painting pictures with words in the mind of the reader. When we describe,  &#10; we let the reader experience something. It may be a thing, a place, a person, or something  &#10; that happens.   &#10; To describe, we start by brainstorming. Let’s use our senses to ask great questions.  &#10; 1. What do you see?  &#10; 2. What do you hear?   &#10; 3. What do you smell?  &#10; 4. What do you taste?  &#10; 5. How does it feel to touch?  &#10; 6. How does it make you feel inside?  &#10; This last question pulls on your emotions. Writing about how you feel gives great voice and  &#10; expression to your writing.   &#10; Once you have finished brainstorming, you will make a plan. From the plan, you will write.  &#10; After you have a paragraph, you will revise and edit.  &#10; In the video, Mr. Butler will walk you through the writing process of brainstorming,  &#10; planning, writing, and revising and editing.  &#10;

2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual  &#10; Your students have been asked to write a descriptive paragraph about a toy. An effective  &#10; approach to the modeling video is to watch it in pieces and interact with your students along  &#10; the way. Watch the introduction and the brainstorming; pause the video; and model with  &#10; your students. The writing process - brainstorming, planning, writing, and revising and  &#10; editing - must become habit. To accomplish that, you will need to constantly model the  &#10; process with them until it becomes natural.  &#10; ASSESSMENT  &#10; What should you expect of your students? The prompt asks for a descriptive paragraph.  &#10; To  &#10; assess this activity, you need to assess the writing process as well.   &#10; • Did they brainstorm?  &#10; • Did they make a bullet plan?  &#10; • Did they write at least five sentences using the plan and the brainstorming? Do the  &#10; sentences reflect descriptive writing? Is there evidence of juicy words - adjectives, action  &#10; verbs, figurative language, etc.? Do the sentences utilize senses and emotions?  &#10; • Did they capitalize the first word of each sentence?   &#10; • Is there end punctuation?  &#10; • Does each sentence make sense?  &#10; Use the rubric to assess their writing. Although your students’ writing may not look exactly  &#10; like this, you will have a general idea of what is acceptable and what isn’t. &#10; "},{"text":"Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

Summary  &#10; In the video, you learned the keyword for descriptive writing is describe. When you see this  &#10; word in directions, you will know you need to describe.   &#10; Mr. Butler helped you brainstorm ways to describe a toy. Mr. Butler made a plan for  &#10; describing. He used bullets as a way to organize the plan. Sentence by sentence, Mr. Butler  &#10; modeled complete sentences that described the toy. Finally, Mr. Butler revised and edited  &#10; the paragraph.  &#10; Your Turn!  &#10; Using the modeled piece of writing, you should write your own descriptive paragraph about  &#10; a toy. The toy can be one from your younger years or a toy you play with currently. Be sure to  &#10; follow the process of brainstorming, planning, writing, and revising and editing as Mr.  &#10; Butler did during the lesson. &#10; "},{"text":"Let’s Write!  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10;

RUBRIC &#10; Exceeds Standards:  &#10; A tattered bear rests peacefully on a shelf in my room. Old pictures sit beside him  &#10; featuring the two of us when we were inseparable. Often, I reflect on those days when all I  &#10; needed was Teddy to feel safe and secure. His warm smile and soft eyes still fill me with a  &#10; level of comfort like nothing else.  &#10; Meets Standards:  &#10; An old teddy bear sits on a shelf in my bedroom. Next to him, old pictures of the two of us  &#10; remind me of a time when he was like a safe, warm blanket. Even now, his beautiful smile  &#10; and welcoming eyes make me feel like a million bucks.  &#10; Below Standards:  &#10; I have an old teddy bear in my room   There are pictures of us two  he has blak eyes and  &#10; he smile and he makes me feel good  &#10; CLICK  &#10; Understanding the skills are quite different from the application of skills. When understanding  &#10; meets application, I call that a “click.” It’s like a puzzle piece finding its companion.   &#10; In this activity, the application of the writing process is the click. When your students apply  &#10; the process viewed in the modeling video to their own writing, they will understand how  &#10; following the process removes frustration from their writing. &#10; "},{"text":"Conventions &#10;

It is one of the six traits of writing  &#10; and commonly part of analytical assessment scoring.   &#10; In Weekly Writer, the instructional videos focus on holistic content writing first and editing for  &#10; punctuation, grammar, and spelling at the end of the writing process. Students need to focus  &#10; first on their content. If the content of the writing isn’t sound, then there is little need to edit.  &#10; By nature, language arts teachers want to edit first for conventions, but if the student has to  &#10; go back and rewrite sentences for content, then they feel like they’ve wasted their efforts.   &#10; Therefore, it is important for you to focus on the content of their writing as a primary goal.  &#10; When the content is firm, then ask the student to edit for punctuation, grammar, and  &#10; spelling.   &#10; In Conventions, the goal is to make basic punctuation and grammar second nature to the  &#10; young writer. Consider these basics:  &#10; • Capitalize the first word of a sentence  &#10; • Capitalize the word “I”  &#10; • Capitalize proper nouns  &#10; • Add end punctuation for a statement, a question, or exclamation  &#10; Next, focus on —  &#10; • Subject and verb agreement  &#10; • Is the sentence a complete thought?  &#10; This week the lesson focuses on different types of sentences including declarative,  &#10; interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory. The Checking for Understanding activity gives  &#10; you a great platform to discuss sentence variety in student writing. &#10; "},{"text":"Checking for Understanding  &#10; Write D for Declarative, Int for Interrogative, Imp for Imperative, or E for Exclamatory. Then,  &#10; add the correct punctuation for each sentence. This will help you understand the craft and  &#10; structure of your sentences.  &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

CLICK  &#10; For this Conventions lesson to click, you will have help connect the pieces. As described  &#10; above, your constant modeling of pointing out different types of sentences is important.  &#10; How many times have you heard a teacher say, “They can’t tell a statement from a question.”  &#10; To eradicate that statement, we have to make the purpose and usage of different types of  &#10; sentences real to our students and never assume “they get it.”   &#10; This concept will be a constant “click” each time you write. As you observe your students, be  &#10; mindful of those who master this concept and those who need more attention.   &#10; Challenge your students to use a variety of different sentence types in their writing. If a book  &#10; had all the same type of sentences it would be a very boring book. A writer wants the reader  &#10; to \"see\" or experience something from what they write and to do this they have to make it  &#10; interesting. The only way to get this across in written form is to add description, vary types of  &#10; sentences, and to be expressive.  &#10; "},{"text":"Application &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

ASSESSMENT  &#10; This is an ongoing activity for the student. Make multiple copies of The Character Worksheet  &#10; and place them in an easily accessible spot in your classroom.   &#10; When a student has an idea for a character, they can fill out a Character Worksheet and add  &#10; it to their Writer’s Workbook. I like to see fifth graders develop the following types of  &#10; characters:  &#10; • Main Characters - These are characters the student wants to use as the main focus of a  &#10; story.  &#10; • Allies - These are friends of the main character  &#10; • Opponents - These are good and bad opponents.  Good opponents are teachers,  &#10; parents, and friends who have the best interest of the main character at heart. Bad  &#10; opponents are bullies or other bad guys in their stories.  &#10; • Ally-Opponent OR Opponent-Ally - These are characters who begin as one type of  &#10; character but develop into another due to the circumstances of the story.  &#10; I highly suggest developing some classroom characters for the entire class to write about in  &#10; your modeling lessons. I have seen amazing examples of how teachers have used classroom  &#10; characters to reinforce character education concepts through narratives they wrote in  &#10; modeling activities. Make these classroom characters part of your classroom family.   &#10; There is an example included in the answer key of how a fifth grader might fill out the  &#10; Character Worksheet. As you review their choices, encourage them to make their character  &#10; their age and grade. There is nothing wrong with having a variety of ages as they develop  &#10; additional characters, but for the time being, they should create about what they know in  &#10; their world.  &#10; "},{"text":"Apply It!  &#10; Fill out the Character Worksheet below.

The question that pops into the minds of most teachers is, “Why are we doing a narrative  &#10; activity while we’re working on descriptive?” Fair question. Although writing has been broken  &#10; down into “modes” of writing, I firmly believe students must learn how to divide and  &#10; conquer! They must be prepared to write in any mode or mix the modes at any time. Do we  &#10; not describe in a narrative or possibly in a science or social studies question? Use this activity  &#10; to build awareness and observational skills with your students. Allow this to transfer into  &#10; other curricular areas as well.  &#10; In the descriptive sentences, make sure your students are not explaining details about the  &#10; character. In other words, if they write — Everyone loves her because she smiles all the time.  &#10; — point out that this is explaining “why” they like her. Notice how I reversed the same  &#10; concept by letting the character have the action. She smiles all the time, and everyone loves  &#10; her.  I deleted the word “because” and used the action verbs “smile” and “loves” to show  &#10; instead of tell or explain.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; Allow this activity to click into multiple activities. Imagine your students filling out a Character  &#10; Worksheet on another classmate, or a character from a novel they are reading, or a character  &#10; from a story in your reading series.   &#10; As for their own work,  students need to start building a collection of character worksheets  &#10; for their narrative writing. Don’t let this one be the only one they do. Encourage your  &#10; students to do several of these over a period of time.   &#10; Additionally, the Character Worksheet asks the students to be observant about what they see  &#10; in their imaginations, and they have to describe as well. This is an excellent opportunity for  &#10; you to drive home the message about descriptive not being just the sense of “seeing.”  &#10; Describing must include all of the senses and emotions to be well-rounded.  &#10; "},{"text":"RIP & Write &#10; *Remember, RIP stands for “Read, Interpret, Predict”  &#10; Reading to comprehend is a skill all to itself. Often, students skim and scan a passage and  &#10; call that reading. Skimming and scanning is a wonderful skill to get an idea of what the  &#10; passage is about, however, it never replaces close reading. When you close read a passage  &#10; you will discover details and inferences in the words.   &#10; RIP is a reading strategy to help you close read a passage. As you read the math word  &#10; problem, you will be guided through the RIP strategy.   &#10; September Birthday  &#10; Read  &#10; Read a short portion of the text. As you read, remember to stop at the periods. Picture  &#10; what’s happening in your imagination. Read with expression even if you are reading in your  &#10; mind!  &#10;   September is the best month ever. The sun is out, the flowers have  &#10; bloomed, and my birthday is on September 15th! My mother said I could have  &#10; five friends over for a party. We will have chips, cupcakes, and pizza to eat.  &#10; Interpret  &#10; We’re not finished reading the passage, but let’s stop and interpret by asking some  &#10; questions.  &#10; • What is the passage about?  &#10; • What clues tell me this will be a math word problem?  &#10; • What information could be important to a math problem?   &#10; Predict  &#10; • What kind of math could I have to do?  &#10; • Will the math problem ask me to find out how much pizza to order?  &#10; "},{"text":"© 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual  RIP & Write  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10; The RIP strategy has been proven to build reading comprehension through close reading. As  &#10; your students are learning the strategy, model it with them. Each element of the strategy is  &#10; key to building reading comprehension. There is nothing wrong with skimming and scanning  &#10; to get a general idea, but it should never replace close reading.  &#10; GUIDE  &#10; As you guide students through this lesson, point out that after reading these sentences, a red  &#10; flag should pop up. This sounds and feels like a math lesson. Watch out! Which information is  &#10; important? In your mind, convert the number words to digits and start predicting what math  &#10; operation you will have to do.  &#10;    &#10; Additionally, take notice of the descriptive language. Is it odd to find descriptive language in  &#10; a math problem? Is descriptive language truly all around us? We need to be observant.  &#10; Now that we know it’s a math problem, let’s be on the lookout for additional information we  &#10; may need to solve a potential problem. And, how will we recognize the instructions? &#10; "},{"text":"Read  &#10; Let’s read the rest of the passage. Don’t forget to stop at the periods, picture it in your mind, and use  &#10; expression in your voice!  &#10;   My mother has put me in charge of figuring out how many pizzas to order. Each of my friends  &#10; attending the party will eat two pieces of pizza, and each pizza has eight slices. I will eat two slices as well.  &#10; How many pizzas do I need to order? Will I have any slices left over?   &#10; Interpret  &#10; We’re finished reading the passage. Let’s stop and interpret by asking some questions.  &#10; • What information is important?  &#10; • How many children, including the author of the passage, will be attending?  &#10; • What math operations will I be doing to solve the problems?  &#10; Predict  &#10; Look at the last sentence. What do you think you will have to do for an activity?  &#10; Your turn!  &#10; 1. Why does the author of the passage like the month of September? Use information from the passage  &#10; and explain.  &#10;   The author likes September because it’s sunny, the flowers are blooming, and it is her birthday.  &#10; 2. Using information from the passage, determine how many pizzas the author needs to order to feed the  &#10; children attending the party. Write a math sentence to find the answer. Be sure to show your work.  &#10; Explain the steps you took to find the answer.   &#10; 5 + 1 = 6             6 x 2 = 12    8 x 2 = 16  &#10;   There will be six children at the party. I added the five guests plus the author for a sum of six. The  &#10; passage stated that each child will eat two slices. I multiplied the six children by two slices each for a  &#10; product of twelve. Since each pizza has eight slices, I know that two pizzas will have sixteen slices. The  &#10; author needs to order two pizzas to have enough for everyone.   &#10; 3. How many slices will be left over? Write a math sentence to find the answer. Be sure to show your work.  &#10; Explain the steps you took to find the answer.  &#10; There will be four slices of pieces left over. Since each child will eat two slices, the author needs a total of  &#10; twelve slices because six times two is twelve. Each pizza has eight slices, and I determined that the author  &#10; needs two pizzas to have enough for everyone. Two pizzas will have sixteen slices because eight times two  &#10; is sixteen. Finally, I subtracted twelve from sixteen, which gave me a difference of four.  &#10; 16 - 12 = 4 &#10; "},{"text":"RIP & Write  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

GUIDE  &#10; Did you see it? There are questions in our instructions. Now, let’s try to fully understand what  &#10; the questions are asking us to do.  &#10; The instructions are very clear. The words “how many” tell us we will either need to use  &#10; addition or multiplication to solve the problem.   &#10; How many children are there? There are five friends attending, but you have to count the  &#10; birthday boy/girl. Also, we know that each pizza has eight slices. If each child eats two slices,  &#10; I think I will need to multiply. I could use addition, but multiplication will be faster. Is it  &#10; possible that I will have to do subtraction at some point? It seems clear that solving this math  &#10; problem will take multiple steps.    &#10; As you guide your students through the RIP & Write lesson, you are clearly modeling the  &#10; process step by step. You are not only building reading comprehension skills, but you are  &#10; building logical thinking skills. Too often, we focus on “thinking out of the box,” and forget  &#10; that students need logical, common sense thinking skills as well. There is nothing difficult  &#10; about this problem if you look at it from a logical perspective.   &#10; When you answer the open-ended questions, be sure to model how students should answer  &#10; in a complete sentence.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; During the week, we have talked about complete sentences. In math, it is important to  &#10; answer open-ended questions with a complete sentence expressing the answer with details.   &#10; Use this opportunity to talk about the parallel of sentence variety in language arts to  &#10; sentence variety in math.  &#10; Before they write their answers to the open-ended sentences, consider the purpose of each  &#10; sentence. Will it be declaring details in a statement? Or, is there a need for another type of  &#10; sentence?  &#10; "},{"text":"Source Writing &#10; Let’s take what we’ve learned this week in Let’s Write, Conventions, and RIP & Write to do  &#10; some Source Writing!   &#10; Answering questions based on multiple sources can be difficult. Over the next few weeks,  &#10; we will break down the process for you step by step. Our goal is to learn how to RIP the  &#10; passages for close reading, find the details needed to answer the questions, and learn how  &#10; to write the answers in our own words. It will also be necessary to cite where you found the  &#10; answer. The word “cite” means to give credit to the source where you found the answer.   &#10; The Approaching Storm  &#10;   Gray, gloomy clouds glide across a dark, dismal sky. Tall, pointy pines sway  &#10; gently on the horizon, and I feel as though they are bowing to me. In the  &#10; distance, a rumble of thunder echoes. A scared squirrel scampers across my  &#10; front yard and dashes for his home in a large, oak tree. As I relax on my porch  &#10; swing, the warm breeze brushes my cheek. I anxiously await the coming storm.   &#10; Did you RIP the passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued,  &#10; what do you think would happen next?  &#10; Clouds, Storms, and Rain  &#10; Wikipedia  &#10;   A cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets made of water in the  &#10; atmosphere. A storm is any disturbed state of an environment affecting its  &#10; surface. It may be marked with strong wind, hail, thunder, lightning, and rain.  &#10; Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from  &#10; atmospheric water vapor and fallen to the earth’s surface due to gravity.   &#10; Did you RIP this passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued,  &#10; what do you think would happen next?  &#10; "},{"text":"Source Writing  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual©  &#10; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual  &#10; In your activity, students are asked to locate details from the passage and answer openended  &#10; questions based on information and inference. If they did not RIP the passage, it is  &#10; possible they only skimmed and scanned. The result will be frustrating to them; they will have  &#10; no clue how to answer the questions.   &#10; The first question asks them to state their opinion about whether or not the author likes  &#10; storms. The evidence to support the answer is there, but the student must understand the  &#10; inference and description of feeling to draw this conclusion.   &#10; The second question asks the student to draw from the informational passage. Even though  &#10; the passage only lists the effects a storm can have on the surface of our planet, the student  &#10; must draw on known knowledge and logic to carry through with details of how wind, hail,  &#10; and lightning can affect us.   &#10; Finally, students are asked to write two sentences about the swaying trees. Guide your  &#10; students to utilize the writing process of brainstorming, planning, writing, and revising and  &#10; editing to create these two sentences. If they are having trouble with this, you may have to  &#10; model it for them in a group activity and then ask them to write two descriptive sentences on  &#10; their own.  &#10; ASSESSMENT  &#10; Source writing brings it all together. One passage is descriptive and one is explanatory. The  &#10; questions following the passages ask the students to do a variety of tasks.  &#10; • They have to identify descriptive details in the passage.   &#10; • Students have to use information from the passage to draw conclusions based on  &#10; knowledge and understanding.  &#10; • Students have to explain the personification by interpreting its meaning from the  &#10; descriptive passage. &#10; "},{"text":"Let’s Source Write   &#10; Step one in source writing is understanding. If you have read the two passages, you are  &#10; aware of how different they are. One is a descriptive passage and one is an explanatory  &#10; passage. How do you know that?   &#10; The Approaching Storm is written from the author’s viewpoint and describes what the  &#10; author sees, hears, and feels as a storm develops. Clouds, Storms, and Rain gives you  &#10; information about the elements in a storm. Notice the credit to Wikipedia, an online free  &#10; encyclopedia.   &#10; The next step is to answer the following questions in one or two sentences. This will help  &#10; you determine if you RIP’ed the passages to clearly understand details, structure, and your  &#10; own interpretation as it relates to you.  &#10; Your turn!  &#10; Answer the following questions in one or two sentences. To the best of your ability, give  &#10; credit to the passage where you found the information. Refer to the passage by its title.  &#10; For example — In The Approaching Storm, the squirrel was scared because of the thunder.   &#10; When you use the title in your answer, you are giving credit to the passage.   &#10; 1. Do you think the author of “The Approaching Storm” likes or dislikes storms? Use information from the  &#10; passage to support your opinion.  &#10; I think the author enjoyed storms. He is sitting on his porch in a swing to watch the storm. If he was afraid  &#10; of the storm or didn’t like it, he wouldn’t be sitting on the porch.   &#10; 2. How do you think a storm can affect the surface of our planet? Use information from the passage to  &#10; explain the good and bad effects of a storm.   &#10;   In the passage, Clouds, Storms, and Rain, it states that strong wind, hail, thunder, and lightning are  &#10; possible during a storm. Strong winds can damage houses because trees can fall on them. Hail can be large  &#10; or small, but it is very hard. If hail falls on a car it can dent the car. If it hits the roof of a house, it can  &#10; damage the roof. Thunder is only a noise, but it can rattle windows and scare everyone on the surface.  &#10; Lighting can strike the ground, trees, and even people, which can lead to damage or death.  &#10; 3.  Why do think the author of the descriptive passage stated that he/she felt the trees were bowing to  &#10; them? Use information from the passage to draw a conclusion and explain your thoughts.  &#10;   In the passage, the author stated that the tall, pointy pines were swaying. If a tree is swaying, it could  &#10; look like it was bowing because the tree is bending over. &#10; "},{"text":"Source Writing  &#10; Teacher’s Guide &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;
