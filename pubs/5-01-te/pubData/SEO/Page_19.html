		Source Writing  &#10; Teacher&#8217;s Guide &#10; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual&#169;  &#10; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual  &#10; In your activity, students are asked to locate details from the passage and answer openended  &#10; questions based on information and inference. If they did not RIP the passage, it is  &#10; possible they only skimmed and scanned. The result will be frustrating to them; they will have  &#10; no clue how to answer the questions.   &#10; The first question asks them to state their opinion about whether or not the author likes  &#10; storms. The evidence to support the answer is there, but the student must understand the  &#10; inference and description of feeling to draw this conclusion.   &#10; The second question asks the student to draw from the informational passage. Even though  &#10; the passage only lists the effects a storm can have on the surface of our planet, the student  &#10; must draw on known knowledge and logic to carry through with details of how wind, hail,  &#10; and lightning can affect us.   &#10; Finally, students are asked to write two sentences about the swaying trees. Guide your  &#10; students to utilize the writing process of brainstorming, planning, writing, and revising and  &#10; editing to create these two sentences. If they are having trouble with this, you may have to  &#10; model it for them in a group activity and then ask them to write two descriptive sentences on  &#10; their own.  &#10; ASSESSMENT  &#10; Source writing brings it all together. One passage is descriptive and one is explanatory. The  &#10; questions following the passages ask the students to do a variety of tasks.  &#10; &#8226; They have to identify descriptive details in the passage.   &#10; &#8226; Students have to use information from the passage to draw conclusions based on  &#10; knowledge and understanding.  &#10; &#8226; Students have to explain the personification by interpreting its meaning from the  &#10; descriptive passage. &#10;
