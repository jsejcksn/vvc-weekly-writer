		Read  &#10; Let&#8217;s read the rest of the passage. Don&#8217;t forget to stop at the periods, picture it in your mind, and use  &#10; expression in your voice!  &#10;   My mother has put me in charge of figuring out how many pizzas to order. Each of my friends  &#10; attending the party will eat two pieces of pizza, and each pizza has eight slices. I will eat two slices as well.  &#10; How many pizzas do I need to order? Will I have any slices left over?   &#10; Interpret  &#10; We&#8217;re finished reading the passage. Let&#8217;s stop and interpret by asking some questions.  &#10; &#8226; What information is important?  &#10; &#8226; How many children, including the author of the passage, will be attending?  &#10; &#8226; What math operations will I be doing to solve the problems?  &#10; Predict  &#10; Look at the last sentence. What do you think you will have to do for an activity?  &#10; Your turn!  &#10; 1. Why does the author of the passage like the month of September? Use information from the passage  &#10; and explain.  &#10;   The author likes September because it&#8217;s sunny, the flowers are blooming, and it is her birthday.  &#10; 2. Using information from the passage, determine how many pizzas the author needs to order to feed the  &#10; children attending the party. Write a math sentence to find the answer. Be sure to show your work.  &#10; Explain the steps you took to find the answer.   &#10; 5 + 1 = 6             6 x 2 = 12    8 x 2 = 16  &#10;   There will be six children at the party. I added the five guests plus the author for a sum of six. The  &#10; passage stated that each child will eat two slices. I multiplied the six children by two slices each for a  &#10; product of twelve. Since each pizza has eight slices, I know that two pizzas will have sixteen slices. The  &#10; author needs to order two pizzas to have enough for everyone.   &#10; 3. How many slices will be left over? Write a math sentence to find the answer. Be sure to show your work.  &#10; Explain the steps you took to find the answer.  &#10; There will be four slices of pieces left over. Since each child will eat two slices, the author needs a total of  &#10; twelve slices because six times two is twelve. Each pizza has eight slices, and I determined that the author  &#10; needs two pizzas to have enough for everyone. Two pizzas will have sixteen slices because eight times two  &#10; is sixteen. Finally, I subtracted twelve from sixteen, which gave me a difference of four.  &#10; 16 - 12 = 4 &#10;
