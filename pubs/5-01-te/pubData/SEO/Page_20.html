		Let&#8217;s Source Write   &#10; Step one in source writing is understanding. If you have read the two passages, you are  &#10; aware of how different they are. One is a descriptive passage and one is an explanatory  &#10; passage. How do you know that?   &#10; The Approaching Storm is written from the author&#8217;s viewpoint and describes what the  &#10; author sees, hears, and feels as a storm develops. Clouds, Storms, and Rain gives you  &#10; information about the elements in a storm. Notice the credit to Wikipedia, an online free  &#10; encyclopedia.   &#10; The next step is to answer the following questions in one or two sentences. This will help  &#10; you determine if you RIP&#8217;ed the passages to clearly understand details, structure, and your  &#10; own interpretation as it relates to you.  &#10; Your turn!  &#10; Answer the following questions in one or two sentences. To the best of your ability, give  &#10; credit to the passage where you found the information. Refer to the passage by its title.  &#10; For example &#8212; In The Approaching Storm, the squirrel was scared because of the thunder.   &#10; When you use the title in your answer, you are giving credit to the passage.   &#10; 1. Do you think the author of &#8220;The Approaching Storm&#8221; likes or dislikes storms? Use information from the  &#10; passage to support your opinion.  &#10; I think the author enjoyed storms. He is sitting on his porch in a swing to watch the storm. If he was afraid  &#10; of the storm or didn&#8217;t like it, he wouldn&#8217;t be sitting on the porch.   &#10; 2. How do you think a storm can affect the surface of our planet? Use information from the passage to  &#10; explain the good and bad effects of a storm.   &#10;   In the passage, Clouds, Storms, and Rain, it states that strong wind, hail, thunder, and lightning are  &#10; possible during a storm. Strong winds can damage houses because trees can fall on them. Hail can be large  &#10; or small, but it is very hard. If hail falls on a car it can dent the car. If it hits the roof of a house, it can  &#10; damage the roof. Thunder is only a noise, but it can rattle windows and scare everyone on the surface.  &#10; Lighting can strike the ground, trees, and even people, which can lead to damage or death.  &#10; 3.  Why do think the author of the descriptive passage stated that he/she felt the trees were bowing to  &#10; them? Use information from the passage to draw a conclusion and explain your thoughts.  &#10;   In the passage, the author stated that the tall, pointy pines were swaying. If a tree is swaying, it could  &#10; look like it was bowing because the tree is bending over. &#10;
