2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual Village Classroom &#169; 2015 Virtual  &#10; GUIDE  &#10; Did you see it? There are questions in our instructions. Now, let&#8217;s try to fully understand what  &#10; the questions are asking us to do.  &#10; The instructions are very clear. The words &#8220;how many&#8221; tell us we will either need to use  &#10; addition or multiplication to solve the problem.   &#10; How many children are there? There are five friends attending, but you have to count the  &#10; birthday boy/girl. Also, we know that each pizza has eight slices. If each child eats two slices,  &#10; I think I will need to multiply. I could use addition, but multiplication will be faster. Is it  &#10; possible that I will have to do subtraction at some point? It seems clear that solving this math  &#10; problem will take multiple steps.    &#10; As you guide your students through the RIP &#38; Write lesson, you are clearly modeling the  &#10; process step by step. You are not only building reading comprehension skills, but you are  &#10; building logical thinking skills. Too often, we focus on &#8220;thinking out of the box,&#8221; and forget  &#10; that students need logical, common sense thinking skills as well. There is nothing difficult  &#10; about this problem if you look at it from a logical perspective.   &#10; When you answer the open-ended questions, be sure to model how students should answer  &#10; in a complete sentence.  &#10; CLICK  &#10; During the week, we have talked about complete sentences. In math, it is important to  &#10; answer open-ended questions with a complete sentence expressing the answer with details.   &#10; Use this opportunity to talk about the parallel of sentence variety in language arts to  &#10; sentence variety in math.  &#10; Before they write their answers to the open-ended sentences, consider the purpose of each  &#10; sentence. Will it be declaring details in a statement? Or, is there a need for another type of  &#10; sentence?  &#10;
