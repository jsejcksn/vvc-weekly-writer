		Source Writing &#10; Let&#8217;s take what we&#8217;ve learned this week in Let&#8217;s Write, Conventions, and RIP &#38; Write to do  &#10; some Source Writing!   &#10; Answering questions based on multiple sources can be difficult. Over the next few weeks,  &#10; we will break down the process for you step by step. Our goal is to learn how to RIP the  &#10; passages for close reading, find the details needed to answer the questions, and learn how  &#10; to write the answers in our own words. It will also be necessary to cite where you found the  &#10; answer. The word &#8220;cite&#8221; means to give credit to the source where you found the answer.   &#10; The Approaching Storm  &#10;   Gray, gloomy clouds glide across a dark, dismal sky. Tall, pointy pines sway  &#10; gently on the horizon, and I feel as though they are bowing to me. In the  &#10; distance, a rumble of thunder echoes. A scared squirrel scampers across my  &#10; front yard and dashes for his home in a large, oak tree. As I relax on my porch  &#10; swing, the warm breeze brushes my cheek. I anxiously await the coming storm.   &#10; Did you RIP the passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued,  &#10; what do you think would happen next?  &#10; Clouds, Storms, and Rain  &#10; Wikipedia  &#10;   A cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets made of water in the  &#10; atmosphere. A storm is any disturbed state of an environment affecting its  &#10; surface. It may be marked with strong wind, hail, thunder, lightning, and rain.  &#10; Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from  &#10; atmospheric water vapor and fallen to the earth&#8217;s surface due to gravity.   &#10; Did you RIP this passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued,  &#10; what do you think would happen next?  &#10;
