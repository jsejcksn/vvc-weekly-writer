If you are asked to write in the descriptive mode, you will see the word describe in the  &#10; prompt or instructions. This is called a keyword. The keyword directs you to what kind of  &#10; writing you are supposed to do.  &#10; Describing is like painting pictures with words in the mind of the reader. When we describe,  &#10; we let the reader experience something. It may be a thing, a place, a person, or something  &#10; that happens.   &#10; To describe, we start by brainstorming. Let&#8217;s use our senses to ask great questions.  &#10; 1. What do you see?  &#10; 2. What do you hear?   &#10; 3. What do you smell?  &#10; 4. What do you taste?  &#10; 5. How does it feel to touch?  &#10; 6. How does it make you feel inside?  &#10; This last question pulls on your emotions. Writing about how you feel gives great voice and  &#10; expression to your writing.   &#10; Once you have finished brainstorming, you will make a plan. From the plan, you will write.  &#10; After you have a paragraph, you will revise and edit.  &#10; In the video, Mr. Butler will walk you through the writing process of brainstorming,  &#10; planning, writing, and revising and editing.  &#10;
