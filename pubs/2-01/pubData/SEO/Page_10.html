		Source Writing &#10; Sources are different types of information. They can be fiction or non-fiction. When you RIP  &#10; a passage, you are doing your best to understand what it says. Sometimes, your teacher will  &#10; ask you questions about details in the passage. Other times, your teacher will ask you  &#10; questions about what you think based on what you have read.   &#10; When you have two or more types of information to look at, the writing you create will be  &#10; called source writing. You will compare the information from all of the sources to answer  &#10; questions for your teacher.   &#10; To answer the questions, you will have to use your own words. If you copy the words from  &#10; the sources, you are a copycat! To learn how to write from sources, you need to practice. In  &#10; this lesson, you will use what you&#8217;ve learned this week to complete the writing activity.  &#10; The Coming Rain  &#10;   The soft, cool breeze tickles Tom&#8217;s cheek. Drip, drop. Drip, drop. Droplets of rain fall  &#10; on his head. Thunder echoes in the distance, and Tom spots a scared squirrel running for his  &#10; home.  &#10; Did you RIP the passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued, what do you think  &#10; would happen next?  &#10; Ellie&#8217;s Walk Home  &#10;   Ellie looks into the puddle, and her big, blue, sparkling eyes stare back at her. Far  &#10; away, thunder rumbles, and Ellie takes out her bright pink umbrella. Dark, gloomy clouds  &#10; roll across the sky, but Ellie is determined to make it home before it rains again.  &#10; Did you RIP this passage? What kind of questions did you ask? If the passage continued, what do you think  &#10; would happen next?  &#10;
