When you describe, the reader experiences  &#10; what’s in your imagination. You can describe a person, a place, a thing, or something that  &#10; happens.   &#10; To brainstorm for ideas of what to write about, let’s ask great questions:  &#10; • What do you see?  &#10; • What do you hear?   &#10; • What do you smell?  &#10; • What do you taste?  &#10; • How does it feel to touch?  &#10; • How does it make you feel inside?  &#10; Using your five senses and your emotions gives your writing lots of details about what you  &#10; are describing.  &#10; In the video, Mr. Butler will walk you through the writing process of brainstorming,  &#10; planning, writing, and revising and editing.  &#10; "},{"text":"Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

Summary  &#10; In the video, you learned the keyword for descriptive writing is describe. When you see this  &#10; word in directions, you will know you need to describe.   &#10; Mr. Butler helped you brainstorm ways to describe a bowl of fruit by using a web. RIP helped  &#10; Mr. Butler make a plan for describing. They used bullets as a way to organize the plan.  &#10; Sentence by sentence, Mr. Butler modeled complete sentences that described the bowl of  &#10; fruit. Finally, RIP helped Mr. Butler revise and edit the paragraph.  &#10; Your Turn!  &#10; Write three or more sentences on your own or with your teacher that describes a bowl of  &#10; fruit. You can use ideas from the brainstorming session with Mr. Butler, or you can create new  &#10; ones on your own. As you describe, be sure to follow the writing process of brainstorming,  &#10; planning, writing, and revising and editing to create your sentences. &#10; "},{"text":"Conventions &#10; Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village Classroom © 2015 Virtual Village  &#10;

Types of Sentences  &#10; In your Let’s Write lesson, Mr. Butler and RIP created a descriptive paragraph about a bowl of  &#10; fruit. Were the sentences complete? Or, were they fragments or run-on sentences?  &#10; A complete sentence is a group of words beginning with a capital letter and ending with a  &#10; period, exclamation point, or question mark. The sentence is a complete thought. Here is an  &#10; example:  &#10; I enjoy reading in my hammock.   &#10; A fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It may begin with  &#10; a capital letter and have ending punctuation but still not be a complete thought. Let’s look at  &#10; a fragment:  &#10; The big brown dog.  &#10; Notice how the fragment told what the sentence would be about but never actually  &#10; completed the thought.   &#10; A run-on sentence is a sentence made up of two or more complete thoughts that have not  &#10; been connected properly. See if you can find what is wrong with this run-on sentence:  &#10; I like to play soccer and I also like to play basketball and I like to play football.   &#10; Run-on sentences can often be fixed by adding a comma and a conjunction (and, but, or)  &#10; between complete thoughts or making each thought a complete sentence.  In this case,  &#10; there are too many thoughts connected by the word “and.” The sentence could easily fixed  &#10; by writing:   &#10; I like to play soccer, basketball, and football.  &#10; "},{"text":"CHECKING FOR UNDERSTANDING  &#10; Decide whether each group of words is a complete sentence, a fragment, or a run-on  &#10; sentence.

Asking  &#10; great questions will help you find great details to use in your writing.   &#10; Soon, you will learn to write stories. You will need to describe the characters in your stories  &#10; so the reader will have a clear picture in their imagination. Like this—  &#10;   Two blonde piggy tails bounced on Ellie’s back as she skipped down the sidewalk.  &#10; She stopped on the corner to make sure the road was clear. As she looked down, Ellie  &#10; spotted a puddle of water, and her sparkling blue eyes stared back at her.   &#10; In this paragraph, there are many ways Ellie was described. Can you answer these questions?  &#10; 1. What color is Ellie’s hair?   &#10; 2. What words described her hairstyle?  &#10; 3. What color are Ellie’s eyes? How do you know?  &#10; 4. Based on the passage, what kind of personality does Ellie have? What word or words in  &#10; the passage gave you a clue?  &#10; Before we can describe a character in a narrative story, we need to create a character, and we  &#10; need to practice describing them.
